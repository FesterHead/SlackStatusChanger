i've lost count of the years 
well, i sang some sad songs 
oh yes, and cried some bad tears 
look out! i'm comin' 
i'm runnin', finding my way back home 
i'm comin' back to look for you 
i'm goin' by the back door 
you've done me no right, 
but you've done me some wrong 
left me lonely each night 
while i sing my sad song 
well, i've had it for now, livin' on the road 
i'm runnin' here, i'm runnin' there 
well, i need it quick and i need it now, 
that's why i'm searchin', that's why i'm lookin' 
this feelin' i can't rise above

i'm wond'rin' what you're gonna do 
take yourself a friend 
yes, you think you're all right, 
here again
i said i played this song so many times before 
the melody keeps repeating 
growing new ideas, 
flowing chords and notes 
like a mountain river bleeding 
on top of a world forever churning 
yes, i've seen your face before 
showing up to me without a scent revealing 
well, i said will it ever change? 
will it stay the same? 
i'd surely like to know before it's over 
won't be long before i stop and play it over 
i've seen your face before 
i've been in one place too long 
is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again? 
what you're doing
well, i see you standin' there with your finger in the air 
ev'rything we do, you wanna leave it up to you 
who do you think you are? 
you think you are a star, 
try'n' to run the town, always try'n' to put us down 
well, you think that you're right you think you're out of sight 
tell me something, mister; why'd you have to make us so uptight? 
i think you need some groovin' 
who do you think you're foolin' now? 
before and after
love won't see my comin' on a sunday noon today

working man

i got no time for livin' yes, i'm workin' all the time 
it seems to me i could live my life a lot better than i think i am 
i guess that's why they call me, they call me the workin' man 
they call me the workin' man i guess that's what i am 
i get home at five o'clock, and i take myself out a nice, cold beer 
always seem to be wond'rin' why there's nothin' goin' down here 
anthem
know that your place in life is where you want to be 
don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me 
keep on looking forward no use in looking round 
carry your head above the crowd and they won't bring you down 
anthem of the heart and mind 
a funeral dirge for eyes gone blind 
we marvel after those who sought 
new wonders in the world they wrought 
live for yourself, there's no one else more worth living for 
begging hands and bleeding hearts will only cry for more 
though i know they've always told you selfishness is wrong 
yet it was for me not you i came to write this song 
best i can
got a living that's rough a future that's tough 
you know what i mean 
blanker's and boasters all the bluffers and posers 
i'm not into that scene 
you can tell me that i've got no class 
look around youl see who's laughing last 
don't give me speeches 'cause they're oh so droll 
leave me alone and let me rock and roll 
i do the best that i can i'm just what i am 
i do the best i can i know just what i am 
got an itching to rock a hate for small talk 
i'm funny that way 
got my sights on the stars won't get that far 
but i'll try anyway 
i just like to please don't like to tease 
i'm easy like that 
don't like long rests i must confess 
i'm an impatient cat 
rock and rollin's a scream making millions my dream 
i do that a lot 
but i'll just give it a try won't let good times pass me by 
they're all i've got 
beneath, between and behind
ten score years ago defeat the kingly foe 
a wondrous dream came into being 
tame the trackless waste 
no virgin land left chaste 
all shining eyes but never seeing 
beneath the noble bird between the proudest words 
behind the beauty, cracks appear 
once with heads held high they sang out to the sky 
why do their shadows bow in fear 
watch the cities rise another ship arrives 
earth's melting pot, and ever growing 
fantastic dreams come true inventing something new 
the greatest minds, but never knowing 
the guns replace the plow 
facades are tarnished now 
the principles have been betrayed 
the dreams's gone stale but still let hope prevail 
hope that history's debt won't be repaid 
by-tor and the snow dog
at the tobes of hades 
the tobes of hades lit by flickering torchlight 
the netherworld is gathered in the glare 
prince by-tor takes the cavern to the northlight 
the sign of eth is rising in the air 
by-tor - knight of darkness, centurion of evil - devil's prince 
across the styx
across the river styx out of the lamplight 
his nemesis is waiting at the gate 
the snow dog - ermine glowing in the dampnight 
coal black eyes, shimmering with hate 
by-tor and the snow dog square for battle, let the fray begin 
the battle over and the dust is clearing 
disciples of the snow dog sound the knell 
rejoicing echoes as the dawn is nearing 
by-tor in defeat retreats to hell 
snow dog - is victorious - the land of the overworld is saved again 
fly by night
airport scurry - flurry faces parade of passers-by 
people going many places with a smile or just a sigh 
waiting, waiting, pass the time 
get in line - gate thirty-nine - the time is not here yet 
why try, i know why 
the feeling inside me says it's time i was gone 
clear head, new life ahead 
i want to be king now not just one more pawn 
fly by night away from here 
change my life again 
fly by night goodbye my dear 
my ship isn't coming and i just can't pretend 
moon rise, thoughtful eyes 
staring back at me from the window beside 
no fright, or hindsight 
leaving behind that empty feeling inside 
start a new chapter i find what i'm after is changing every day 
the change of a season is enough of a reason to want to get away 
quiet and pensive my thoughts apprehensive the hours drift away 
leaving my homeland playing a lonehand my life begins today
making memories
there's a time for feeling as good as we can 
the time is now, and there's no stopping us 
there's a time for living as high as we can 
behind us you will only see our dust 
so we'll just keep smiling, move onward ev'ry day 
try to keep our thoughts away from home 
we're travelling all around, no time to settle down 
satisfy our wanderlust to roam 
you know we're having good days and we hope they're going to last 
our future still looks brighter than our past 
we feel no need to worry no reason to be sad 
our memories remind us maybe road life's not so bad 
from sea to shining sea and a hundred points between 
still we go on digging every show 
the cities in the land all extend a welcome hand 
till morning when it's time for us to go 
rivendell
sunlight dances through the leaves soft winds stir the sighing trees 
lying in the warm grass feel the sun upon your face 
elven songs and endless nights sweet wine and soft relaxing lights 
time will never touch you here in this enchanted place 
i've traveled now for many miles 
it feels so good to see the smiles of of friends who never left your mind 
when you were far away from the golden light of coming dawn 
till the twilight when the sun is gone 
we treasure every season and every passing day 
you feel there's something calling you you're wanting to return 
to where the misty mountains rise and friendly fires burn 
a place you can escape the world where the dark lord cannot go 
peace of mind and sanctuary by loudwater's flow 
we feel the coming of a new day 
darkness gives way to light a new way 
stop here for a while until the world calls you away 
yet you know i've had the feeling 
standing with my senses reeling 
this is the place to grow old till i reach my final day 
in the end
i can see, what you mean it just takes me longer 
i can feel, what you feel it just makes you stronger 
you can take me for a little while 
you can take me, you can make me smile 
in the end 
i know, i know, i know the feeling grows 
i see, i see, i see that it's got to be 
i can do, what you do you just do it better 
i can cry, like you cry it just makes me sadder 
i can shine, like you shine it doesn't make me brighter 
if i think, like you think it don't make my load any lighter
bastille day
there's no bread let them eat cake 
there's no end to what they'll take 
flaunt the fruits of noble birth 
wash the salt into the earth 
but they're marching to bastille day 
la guillotine will claim her bloody prize 
free the dungeons of the innocent 
the king will kneel, and let his kingdom rise 
bloodstained velvet, dirty lace 
naked fear on every face 
see them bow their heads to die as we would bow as they rode by 
and we're marching to bastille day 
sing, o choirs of cacophony 
the king has kneeled, to let his kingdom rise 
lessons taught, but never learned 
all around us anger burns 
guide the future by the past 
long ago the mould was cast 
for they marched up to bastille day 
hear the echoes of the centuries 
power isn't all that money buys 
i looked in the mirror today my eyes just didn't seem so bright 
dreams of youth and simple truths 
so involved with life 
walk down vanity fair memory lane everywhere 
wall street shuffles there dressed in flowing hair 
once we loved the flowers now we ask the price of the land 
once we would take water but now it must be wine 
i'm aging every day 
but even when i'm grey i'll still be grey my way 
lakeside park
midway hawkers calling try your luck with me 
merry-go-round wheezing the same old melody 
a thousand ten cent wonders who could ask for more 
a pocketful of silver the key to heaven's door 
lakeside park willows in the breeze 
lakeside park so many memories 
laughing rides midway lights 
shining stars on summer nights 
days of barefoot freedom racing with the waves 
nights of starlit secrets crackling driftwood flames 
drinking by the lighthouse smoking on the pier
still we saw the magic fading every year 
everyone would gather on the twenty fourth of may 
sitting in the sand to watch the fireworks display 
dancing fires on the beach singing songs together 
though it's just a memory some memories last forever 
the necromancer
as grey traces of dawn tinge the eastern sky
the three travelers, men of willow dale, emerge from the forest shadow fording the river dawn
they turn south, journeying into the dark and forbidding lands of the necromancer 
even now the intensity of his dread power can be felt, weakening the body and saddening the heart 
ultimately they will become empty, mindless spectres 
stripped of will and soul only a thirst for freedom gives them hunger for vengeance 
silence shrouds the forest as the birds announce the dawn 
three travellers ford the river and southward journey on 
the road is lined with peril the air is charged with fear 
the shadow of his nearness weighs like iron tears 
shreds of black cloud loom in overcast skies
the necromancer keeps watch with his magic prism eyes he views all his lands
already aware of the three helpless invaders trapped in his lair 
brooding in the tower watching o'er his land 
holding every creature helplessly they stand 
gaze into his prisms knowing they are near 
lead them to the dungeons spectres numb with fear they bow defeated 
return of the prince 
enter, the champion, prince by-tor appears
to battle for freedom from chains of long years 
the spell has been broken
the dark lands are bright
the wraith of the necromancer soars awayin the night 
stealthily attacking by-tor slays his foe 
the men are free to run now from labyrinths below 
the wraith of necromancer shadows through the sky 
another land to darken with evil prism eye 
terminat hora diem; terminat auctor opus 
the fountain of lamneth
i am born  - i am me 
i am new  - i am free 
look at me - i am young 
sight unseen life unsung 
my eyes have just been opened and they're open very wide 
images around me don't identify inside 
just one blur i recognize the one that soothes and feeds 
my way of life is easy and as simple are my needs 
yet my eyes are drawn toward the mountain in the east 
fascinates and captivates gives my heart no peace 
the mountain holds the sunrise in the prison of the night 
till bursting forth from rocky chains the valley floods with light 
living one long sunrise for to me all things are new 
i've never watched the sky grow pale or strolled through fields of dew 
i do not know of dust to dust i live from breath to breath 
i live to climb that mountain to the fountain of lamneth 
didacts and narpets
stay! 
go! 
work! 
no! 
think! 
live! 
earn! 
give! 
wait! 
fight! 
laugh! 
right!
listen!
no one at the bridge 
crying back to consciousness the coldness grips my skin 
the sky is pitching violently drawn by shrieking winds 
seaspray blurs my vision waves roll by so fast 
save my ship of freedom i'm lashed helpless to the mast 
call out for direction and there's no one there to steer 
shout out for salvation but there's no one there to hear 
cry out supplication for the maelstrom is near 
scream out desperation but no one cares to hear 
remembering when first i held the wheel in my own hands 
i took the helm so eagerly and sailed for distant lands 
but now the sea's too heavy and i just don't understand 
why must my crew desert me when i need a guiding hand 
panacea 
the whiteness of confusion is unfolding from my mind 
i stare around in wonder have i left my life behind 
i catch the scent of ambergris and turn my head surprised 
my gaze is caught and held and i am helpless, mesmerized 
panacea ~ liquid grace 
oh let me touch your fragile face 
enchantment falls around me and i know i cannot leave 
here's a meaning for my life a shelter from the storm 
pacify my troubles with her body soft and warm 
a smile for every tear 
gentle hands that promise me comfort through the years 
yet i know i must be gone before the light of dawn 
panacea ~ passion pure 
i can't resist your gentle lure 
my heart will lie beside you and my wandering body grieves 
bacchus plateau 
another endless day silhouettes of grey 
another glass of wine drink with eyes that shine 
to days without that chill at morning nights time out of mind 
draw another goblet from the cask of '43 
crimson misty memory hazy glimpse of me 
give me back my wonder - i've something more to give 
another foggy dawn the mountain almost gone 
another doubtful fear the road is not so clear 
the fountain 
look the mist is rising and the sun is peaking through 
see, the steps grow lighter as i reach their final few 
hear, the dancing waters i must be drawing near 
feel, my heart is pounding with embattled hope and fear 
now, at last i fall before the fountain of lamneth 
i thought i would be singing but i'm tired out of breath 
many journeys end here but, the secret's told the same 
life is just a candle and a dream must give it flame' 
the key, the end, the answer stripped of their disguise 
still it's all confusion and tears spring to my eyes 
though i've reached a signpost it's really not the end 
like old sol' behind the mountain i'll be coming up again 
i'm in motion 
still i am
2112
and the meek shall inherit the earth
temples of syrinx 
we've taken care of everything 
the words you read the songs you sing 
the pictures that give pleasure to your eye 
one for all and all for one work together 
common sons never need to wonder how or why 
we are the priests of the temples of syrinx 
our great computers fill the hallowed halls 
all the gifts of life are held within our walls 
look around this world we made 
equality our stock in trade 
come and join the brotherhood of man 
what a nice contented world 
let the banners be unfurled 
hold the red star proudly high in hand 
what can this strange device be? 
when i touch it, it gives forth a sound 
it's got wires that vibrate, and give music 
what can this thing be that i found? 
see how it sings like a sad heart and joyously screams out its pain 
sounds that build high like a mountain
notes that fall gently, like rain 
i can't wait to share this new wonder
the people will all see its light 
let them all make their own music 
the priests praise my name on this night 
i know it's most unusual to come before you so 
but i've found an ancient miracle i thought that you should know 
listen to my music and hear what it can do 
there's something here as strong as life 
i know that it will reach you 
yes, we know - it's nothing new - it's just a waste of time 
we have no need for ancient ways our world is doing fine 
another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man 
forget about your silly whim it doesn't fit the plan 
i can't believe you're saying these things just can't be true 
our world could use this beauty just think what we might do 
don't annoy us further we have our work to do 
just think about the average what use have they for you? 
i wandered home though the silent streets and fell into a fitful sleep 
escape to realms beyond the night dream - can't you show me the light 
i stand atop a spiral stair an oracle confronts me there 
he leads me on, light years away through astral nights, galactic days 
i see the works of gifted hands grace this strange and wondrous land 
i see the hand of man arise with hungry mind and open eyes 
they left the planet long ago the elder race still learn and grow 
their power grows with purpose strong to claim the home where they belong 
home to tear the temples down - home to change
the sleep is still in my eyes the dream is still in my head 
i heave a sigh, and sadly smile and lie a while in bed 
i wish that it might come to pass not fade like all my dreams 
just think of what my life might be in a world like i have seen 
the grand finale 
attention all planets of the solar federation 
we have assumed control 
a passage to bangkok
our first stop is in bogota to check colombian fields 
the natives smile and pass along a sample of their yield 
sweet jamaican pipe dreams golden acapulco nights 
then morocco, and the east, fly by morning light 
we're on the train to bangkok 
aboard the thailand express 
we'll hit the stops along the way 
we only stop for the best 
wreathed in smoke in lebanon we burn the midnight oil 
the fragrance of afghanistan rewards a long day's toil 
pulling into katmandu smoke rings fill the air 
perfumed by a nepal night the express gets you there 
the twilight zone
a pleasant faced man steps up to greet you 
he smiles and says he's pleased to meet you 
beneath his hat the strangeness lies 
take it off, he's got three eyes 
truth is false and logic lost 
now the fourth dimension is crossed 
you have entered the twilight zone 
beyond this world strange things are known 
use the key, unlock the door 
see what your fate might have in store 
come explore your dreams' creation 
enter this world of imagination 
wake up lost in an empty town 
wondering why no one else is around 
look up to see a giant boy 
you've just become his brand new toy 
no escape, no place to hide 
here where time and space collide 
lessons
sweet memories flashing very quickly by 
reminding me giving me a reason why 
i know that my goal is more than a thought 
i'll be there when i teach what i've been taught 
you know we've told you before but you didn't hear us then 
so you still question why you didn't listen again 
sweet memories i never thought it would be like this 
reminding me just how close i came to missing 
i know that this is the way for me to go 
you'll be there when you know what i know 
something for nothing
waiting for the winds of change to sweep the clouds away 
waiting for the rainbow's end to cast its gold your way 
countless ways you pass the days 
waiting for someone to call and turn your world around 
looking for an answer to the question you have found 
looking for an open door 
you don't get something for nothing 
you don't get freedom for free 
you won't get wise with the sleep still in your eyes 
no matter what your dreams might be 
what you own is your own kingdom 
what you do is your own glory 
what you love is your own power 
what you live is your own story 
in your head is the answer let it guide you along 
let your heart be the anchor and the beat of your own song
a farewell to kings
when they turn the pages of history 
when these days have passed long ago 
will they read of us with sadness for the seeds that we let grow 
we turned our gaze from the castles in the distance 
eyes cast down on the path of least resistance 
cities full of hatred fear and lies 
withered hearts and cruel, tormented eyes 
scheming demons dressed in kingly guise 
beating down the multitude and scoffing at the wise 
the hypocrites are slandering the sacred halls of truth 
ancient nobles showering their bitterness on youth 
can't we find the minds that made us strong 
can't we learn to feel what's right and wrong 
can't we raise our eyes and make a start 
can't we find the minds to lead us closer to the heart
xanadu
to seek the sacred river alph to walk the caves of ice 
to break my fast on honey dew and drink the milk of paradise
i had heard the whispered tales of immortality 
the deepest mystery from an ancient book i took a clue 
i scaled the frozen mountain tops of eastern lands unknown 
time and man alone searching for the lost xanadu 
xanadu to stand within the pleasure dome 
decreed by kubla khan 
to taste anew the fruits of life the last immortal man 
to find the sacred river alph to walk the caves of ice 
oh, i will dine on honey dew and drink the milk of paradise 
a thousand years have come and gone but time has passed me by 
stars stopped in the sky frozen in an everlasting view 
waiting for the world to end weary of the night 
praying for the light prison of the lost xanadu 
xanadu held within the pleasure dome 
to taste my bitter triumph as a mad immortal man 
nevermore shall i return escape these caves of ice 
for i have dined on honey dew and drunk the milk of paradise
closer to the heart
and the men who hold high places must be the ones to start 
to mould a new reality closer to the heart 
the blacksmith and the artist reflect it in their art 
forge their creativity closer to the heart 
philosophers and ploughmen each must know his part 
to sow a new mentality closer to the heart 
you can be the captain i will draw the chart 
sailing into destiny closer to the heart 
cinderella man
a modest man from mandrake travelled rich to the city 
he had a need to discover a use for his newly-found wealth 
because he was human because he had goodness 
because he was moral they called him insane 
delusions of grandeur visions of splendour 
a manic depressive he walks in the rain 
eyes wide open heart undefended 
innocence untarnished cinderella man 
doing what you can they can't understand what it means 
cinderella man hang on to your plans 
try as they might they cannot steal your dreams 
in the betrayal of his love he awakened to face a world of cold reality 
and a look in the eyes of the hungry awakened him to what he could do 
he held up his riches to challenge the hungry 
purposeful motion for one so insane 
they tried to fight him just couldn't beat him 
this manic depressive who walks in the rain 
madrigal
when the dragons grow too mighty to slay with pen or sword 
i grow weary of the battle and the storm i walk toward 
when all around is madness and there's no safe port in view 
i long to turn my path homeward to stop awhile with you 
when life becomes so barren and as cold as winter skies 
there's a beacon in the darkness in a distant pair of eyes 
in vain to search for order in vain to search for truth 
but these things can still be given your love has shown me proof 
in the constellation of cygnus there lurks a mysterious, invisible force 
the black hole of cygnus x-1 
six stars of the northern cross 
in mourning for their sister's loss 
in a final flash of glory 
nevermore to grace the night 
invisible to telescopic eye 
infinity the star that would not die 
all who dare to cross her course 
are swallowed by a fearsome force 
through the void to be destroyed 
or is there something more? 
atomized - at the core - or through the astral door - to soar 
i set a course just east of lyra and northwest of pegasus 
flew into the light of deneb sailed across the milky way 
on my ship, the 'rocinante' wheeling through the galaxies, 
headed for the heart of cygnus headlong into mystery 
the x-ray is her siren song my ship cannot resist her long 
nearer to my deadly goal until the black hole - gains control 
spinning, whirling, still descending like a spiral sea, unending 
sound and fury drowns my heart every nerve is torn apart
cygnus x-1 book two: hemispheres
when our weary world was young the struggle of the ancients first began 
the gods of love and reason sought alone to rule the fate of man 
they battled through the ages but still neither force would yield 
the people were divided, every soul a battlefield 
apollo bringer of wisdom 
i bring truth and understanding
i bring wit and wisdom fairprecious gifts beyond compare 
we can build a world of wonder, i can make you all aware
i will find you food and shelter
show you fire to keep you warm through the endless winter storm 
you can live in grace and comfort in the world that you transform
the people were delighted coming forth to claim their prize 
they ran to build their cities and converse among the wise 
but one day the streets fell silent yet they knew not what was wrong 
the urge to build these fine things seemed not to be so strong 
the wise men were consulted and the bridge of death was crossed 
in quest of dionysus to find out what they had lost 
dionysus bringer of love 
i bring love to give you solace in the darkness of the night 
in the heart's eternal light you need only trust your feelings 
only love can steer you right
i bring laughter, i bring music
i bring joy and i bring tears 
i will soothe your primal fears 
throw off those chains of reason and your prison disappears
the cities were abandoned and the forests echoed song 
they danced and lived as brothers they knew love could not be wrong 
food and wine they had aplenty and they slept beneath the stars 
the people were contented and the gods watched from afar 
but the winter fell upon them and it caught them unprepared 
bringing wolves and cold starvation and the hearts of men despaired 
armageddon the battle of heart and mind 
the universe divided as the heart and mind collided 
with the people left unguided for so many troubled years 
in a cloud of doubts and fears
their world was torn asunder into hollow hemispheres 
some fought themselves, some fought each other 
most just followed one another 
lost and aimless like their brothers for their hearts were so unclear 
and the truth could not appear
their spirits were divided into blinded hemispheres 
some who did not fight brought tales of old to light 
my rocinante sailed by night on her final flight 
to the heart of cygnus' fearsome force we set our course 
spiralled through that timeless space to this immortal place 
cygnus bringer of balance 
i have memory and awareness but i have no shape or form 
as a disembodied spirit i am dead and yet unborn 
i have passed into olympus as was told in tales of old 
to the city of immortals marble white and purest gold 
i see the gods in battle rage on high thunderbolts across the sky 
i cannot move, i cannot hide i feel a silent scream begin inside 
then all at once the chaos ceased a stillness fell, a sudden peace 
the warriors felt my silent cry and stayed their struggle, mystified 
apollo was astonished dionysus thought me mad 
but they heard my story further and they wondered, and were sad 
looking down from olympus on a world of doubt and fear 
its surface splintered into sorry hemispheres 
they sat a while in silence then they turned at last to me 
we will call you cygnus the god of balance you shall be
the sphere a kind of dream 
we can walk our road together if our goals are all the same 
we can run alone and free if we pursue a different aim 
let the truth of love be lighted let the love of truth shine clear 
sensibility armed with sense and liberty 
with the heart and mind united in a single perfect sphere 
circumstances
a boy alone, and so far from home 
endless rooftops from my window 
i felt the gloom of empty rooms on rainy afternoons 
sometimes in confusion i felt so lost and disillusioned 
innocence gave me confidence to go up against reality 
all the same we take our chances
laughed at by time, tricked by circumstances 
plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose
the more that things change the more they stay the same 
now i've gained some understanding of the only world that we see 
things that i once dreamed of have become reality 
these walls that still surround me still contain the same old me 
just one more who's searching for the world that ought to be 
the trees
there is unrest in the forest there is trouble with the trees 
for the maples want more sunlight and the oaks ignore their pleas 
the trouble with the maples and they're quite convinced they're right
they say the oaks are just too lofty and they grab up all the light 
but the oaks can't help their feelings if they like the way they're made 
and they wonder why the maples can't be happy in their shade? 
there is trouble in the forest and the creatures all have fled 
as the maples scream oppression! and the oaks, just shake their heads 
so the maples formed a union and demanded equal rights 
the oaks are just too greedy we will make them give us light
now there's no more oak oppression for they passed a noble law 
and the trees are all kept equal by hatchet, axe, and saw 
la villa strangiato
an exercise in self-indulgence
buenas noches, mein froinds! 
to sleep, perchance to dream 
a lerxst in wonderland 
monsters! 
danforth and pape 
the waltz of the shreves 
never turn your back on a monster! 
a farewell to things
the spirit of radio
begin the day with a friendly voice 
a companion, unobtrusive 
plays the song that's so elusive 
and the magic music makes your morning mood 
off on your way hit the open road 
there is magic at your fingers 
for the spirit ever lingers 
undemanding contact in your happy solitude 
invisible airwaves crackle with life 
bright antennae bristle with the energy 
emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength 
bearing a gift beyond price - almost free 
all this machinery making modern music 
can still be open-hearted not so coldly charted 
it's really just a question of your honesty 
one likes to believe in the freedom of music 
but glittering prizes and endless compromises 
shatter the illusion of integrity 
for the words of the profits, are written on the studio wall, concert hall
echoes with the sounds of salesmen
freewill
there are those who think that life has nothing left to chance 
with a host of holy horrors to direct our aimless dance 
a planet of playthings we dance on the strings of powers we cannot perceive 
the stars aren't aligned - or the gods are malign
blame is better to give than receive 
you can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice 
if you choose not to decide you still have made a choice 
you can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill 
i will choose a path that's clear i will choose free will 
there are those who think that they were dealt a losing hand 
the cards were stacked against them they weren't born in lotus-land 
all pre-ordained a prisoner in chains a victim of venomous fate 
kicked in the face you can't pray for a place in heaven's unearthly estate 
each of us a cell of awareness imperfect and incomplete 
genetic blends with uncertain ends on a fortune hunt that's far too fleet
jacob's ladder
the clouds prepare for battle in the dark and brooding silence 
bruised and sullen stormclouds have the light of day obscured 
looming low and ominous in twilight premature 
thunderheads are rumbling in a distant overture 
all at once, the clouds are parted 
light streams down in bright unbroken beams 
follow men's eyes as they look to the skies 
the shifting shafts of shining weave the fabric of their dreams 
entre nous
we are secrets to each other 
each one's life a novel no-one else has read 
even joined in bonds of love we're linked to one another by such slender threads 
we are planets to each other 
drifting in our orbits to a brief eclipse 
each of us a world apart alone and yet together like two passing ships 
just between us 
i think it's time for us to recognize 
the differences we sometimes fear to show 
i think it's time for us to realize 
the spaces in between leave room for you and i to grow 
we are strangers to each other 
full of sliding panels an illusion show 
acting well-rehearsed routines or playing from the heart? 
it's hard for one to know 
we are islands to each other 
building hopeful bridges on a troubled sea 
some are burned or swept away some we would not choose 
but we're not always free 
different strings
who's come to slay the dragon - come to watch him fall? 
making arrows out of pointed words giant killers at the call 
too much fuss and bother too much contradiction and confusion 
peel away the mystery here's a clue to some real motivation 
all there really is the two of us and we both know why we've come along 
nothing to explain it's a part of us to be found within a song 
what happened to our innocence - did it go out of style? 
along with our naiveté - no longer a child 
different eyes see different things 
different hearts beat on different strings 
but there are times for you and me when all such things agree 
natural science
tide pools 
when the ebbing tide retreats along the rocky shoreline 
it leaves a trail of tidal pools in a short-lived galaxy 
each microcosmic planet a complete society 
a simple kind mirror to reflect upon our own 
all the busy little creatures chasing out their destinies 
living in their pools they soon forget about the sea 
wheels within wheels in a spiral array 
a pattern so grand and complex 
time after time we lose sight of the way 
our causes can't see their effects 
hyperspace 
a quantum leap forward in time and in space 
the universe learned to expand 
the mess and the magic triumphant and tragic 
a mechanized world, out of hand 
computerized clinic for superior cynics 
who dance to a synthetic band 
in their own image their world is fashioned
no wonder they don't understand 
wheels within wheels in a spiral array 
permanent waves 
science, like nature must also be tamed with a view towards its preservation 
given the same state of integrity it will surely serve us well 
art as expression - not as market campaigns - will still capture our imaginations 
given the same state of integrity it will surely help us along 
the most endangered species - the honest man - will still survive annihilation 
forming a world state of integrity-  sensitive, open and strong 
wave after wave 
will flow with the tide and bury the world as it does 
tide after tide will flow and recede leaving life to go on as it was
tom sawyer
a modern-day warrior mean mean stride 
today's tom sawyer mean mean pride 
though his mind is not for rent don't put him down as arrogant 
his reserve, a quiet defense riding out the day's events - the river 
what you say about his company is what you say about society 
catch the mist - catch the myth 
catch the mystery - catch the drift 
the world is the world is love and life are deep 
maybe as his skies are wide 
today's tom sawyer he gets high on you 
and the space he invades he gets by on you 
no, his mind is not for rent to any god or government 
always hopeful, yet discontent 
he knows changes aren't permanent - but change is 
what you say about his company is what you say about society 
catch the witness - catch the wit 
catch the spirit - catch the spit 
maybe as his eyes are wide 
exit the warrior today's tom sawyer 
he gets high on you and the energy you trade 
he gets right on to the friction of the day 
red barchetta
my uncle has a country place, that no-one knows about 
he says it used to be a farm, before the motor law 
sundays i elude the 'eyes', and hop the turbine freight 
to far outside the wire, where my white-haired uncle waits 
jump to the ground as the turbo slows to cross the borderline 
run like the wind as excitement shivers up and down my spine 
down in his barn my uncle preserved for me an old machine
for fifty-odd years to keep it as new has been his dearest dream 
i strip away the old debris, that hides a shining car 
a brilliant red barchetta, from a better, vanished time 
fire up the willing engine, responding with a roar! 
tires spitting gravel, i commit my weekly crime 
wind in my hair - shifting and drifting
mechanical music adrenalin surge
well-weathered leather hot metal and oil 
the scented country air 
sunlight on chrome the blur of the landscape 
every nerve aware 
suddenly ahead of me, across the mountainside 
a gleaming alloy air-car shoots towards me, two lanes wide 
i spin around with shrieking tires, to run the deadly race 
go screaming through the valley as another joins the chase 
drive like the wind straining the limits of machine and man 
laughing out loud with fear and hope, i've got a desperate plan 
at the one-lane bridge i leave the giants stranded at the riverside 
race back to the farm to dream with my uncle at the fireside
limelight
living on a lighted stage approaches the unreal for those who think and feel 
in touch with some reality beyond the gilded cage 
cast in this unlikely role, ill-equipped to act with insufficient tact 
one must put up barriers to keep oneself intact 
living in the limelight the universal dream for those who wish to seem 
those who wish to be must put aside the alienation 
get on with the fascination the real relation the underlying theme 
living in a fisheye lens caught in the camera eye 
i have no heart to lie 
i can't pretend a stranger is a long-awaited friend 
all the world's indeed a stage and we are merely players 
performers and portrayers 
each another's audience outside the gilded cage 
the camera eye
grim-faced and forbidding their faces closed tight 
an angular mass of new yorkers pacing in rhythm 
race the oncoming night 
they chase through the streets of manhattan head-first humanity 
pause at a light then flow through the streets of the city 
they seem oblivious to a soft spring rain 
like an english rain 
so light, yet endless from a leaden sky 
the buildings are lost in their limitless rise 
my feet catch the pulse and the purposeful stride 
i feel the sense of possibilities 
i feel the wrench of hard realities 
the focus is sharp in the city
wide-angle watcher on life's ancient tales 
steeped in the history of london 
green and grey washes in a wispy white veil 
mist in the streets of westminster 
wistful and weathered the pride still prevails 
alive in the streets of the city 
are they oblivious to this quality? 
a quality of light unique to every city's streets 
pavements may teem with intense energy 
but the city is calm in this violent sea
witch hunt
the night is black without a moon 
the air is thick and still 
the vigilantes gather on the lonely torchlit hill 
features distorted in the flickering light 
the faces are twisted and grotesque 
silent and stern in the sweltering night 
the mob moves like demons possessed 
quiet in conscience, calm in their right 
confident their ways are best 
the righteous rise with burning eyes of hatred and ill-will 
madmen fed on fear and lies to beat, and burn, and kill 
they say there are strangers, who threaten us in our immigrants and infidels 
they say there is strangeness, too dangerous in our theatres and bookstore shelves 
that those who know what's best for us - must rise and save us from ourselves 
quick to judge, quick to anger, slow to understand 
ignorance and prejudice and fear walk hand in hand
vital signs
unstable condition: a symptom of life, in mental, and environmental change 
atmospheric disturbance - the feverish flux
of human interface and interchange 
the impulse is pure
sometimes our circuits get shorted, by external interference 
signals get crossed
and the balance distorted by internal incoherence 
a tired mind become a shape-shifter 
everybody need a mood lifter 
everybody need reverse polarity 
everybody got mixed feelings about the function and the form 
everybody got to deviate from the norm 
an ounce of perception - a pound of obscure 
process information at half speed 
pause: rewind - replay
warm memory chip 
random-sample - hold the one you need 
leave out the fiction 
the fact is; this friction will only be worn by persistence 
leave out conditions 
courageous convictions will drag the dream into existence 
a tired mind become a shape-shifter 
everybody need a soft filter 
everybody need reverse polarity 
subdivisions
sprawling on the fringes of the city 
in geometric order an insulated border 
in between the bright lights and the far unlit unknown 
growing up it all seems so one-sided 
opinions all provided the future pre-decided 
detached and subdivided in the mass production zone 
nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone 
subdivisions - in the high school halls 
subdivisions - in the shopping malls 
conform or be cast out 
subdivisions - in the basement bars 
subdivisions - in the backs of cars 
be cool or be cast out 
any escape might help to smooth the unattractive truth 
but the suburbs have no charms to soothe the restless dreams of youth 
drawn like moths we drift into the city 
the timeless old attraction cruising for the action 
lit up like a firefly just to feel the living night 
some will sell their dreams for small desires 
or lose the race to rats get caught in ticking traps 
and start to dream of somewhere to relax their restless flight 
somewhere out of a memory of lighted streets on quiet nights 
the analog kid
a hot and windy august afternoon has the trees in constant motion 
with a flash of silver leaves as they're rocking in the breeze 
the boy lies in the grass with one blade stuck between his teeth 
a vague sensation quickens in his young and restless heart 
and a bright and nameless vision has him longing to depart 
you move me -- you move me
with your buildings and your eyes 
autumn woods and winter skies 
open sea and city lights 
busy streets and dizzy heights 
you call me -- you call me
the fawn-eyed girl with sun-browned legs dances on the edge of his dream 
and her voice rings in his ears like the music of the spheres 
the boy lies in the grass, unmoving staring at the sky 
his mother starts to call him as a hawk goes soaring by 
the boy pulls down his baseball cap and covers up his eyes 
too many hands on my time 
too many feelings -- too many things on my mind 
when i leave i don't know what i'm hoping to find 
when i leave i don't know what i'm leaving behind 
chemistry
signals transmitted message received 
reaction making impact - invisibly 
elemental telepathy exchange of energy 
reaction making contact - mysteriously 
eye to i reaction burning hotter 
two to one reflection on the water 
h to o no flow without the other 
oh but how do they make contact with one another? 
electricity? biology? seems to me it's chemistry 
emotion transmitted emotion received 
music in the abstract - positively 
elemental empathy a change of synergy 
music making contact - naturally 
one, two, three - add without subtraction 
sound on sound multiplied reaction 
digital man
his world is under observation - we monitor his station 
under faces and the places where he traces points of view 
he picks up scraps of conversation - radio and radiation 
from the dancers and romancers with the answers - but no clue 
he'd love to spend the night in zion 
he's been a long while in babylon 
he'd like a lover's wings to fly on to a tropic isle of avalon 
his world is under anaesthetic - subdivided and synthetic 
his reliance on the giants in the science of the day 
he picks up scraps of information - he's adept at adaptation 
'cause for strangers and arrangers constant change is here to stay 
he's got a force field and a flexible plan 
he's got a date with fate in a black sedan 
he plays fast forward for as long as he can 
but he won't need a bed - he's a digital man 
the weapon
we've got nothing to fear -- but fear itself? 
not pain or failure, not fatal tragedy? 
not the faulty units in this mad machinery? 
not the broken contacts in emotional chemistry? 
with an iron fist in a velvet glove we are sheltered under the gun 
in the glory game on the power train thy kingdom's will be done 
and the things that we fear are a weapon to be held against us 
he's not afraid of your judgement 
he knows of horrors worse than your hell 
and the things that he fears are a weapon to be held against him 
can any part of life -- be larger than life? 
even love must be limited by time 
and those who push us down that they might climb
is any killer worth more than his crime? 
like a steely blade in a silken sheath 
we don't see what they're made of 
they shout about love, but when push comes to shove 
they live for the things they're afraid of 
and the knowledge that they fear is a weapon to be used against them 
new world man
he's a rebel and a runner he's a signal turning green 
he's a restless young romantic wants to run the big machine 
he's got a problem with his poisons but you know he'll find a cure 
he's cleaning up his systems to keep his nature pure 
learning to match the beat of the old world man 
learning to catch the heat of the third world man 
he's got to make his own mistakes and learn to mend the mess he makes 
he's old enough to know what's right but young enough not to choose it 
he's noble enough to win the world but weak enough to lose it
he's a new world man 
he's a radio receiver tuned to factories and farms 
he's a writer and arranger and a young boy bearing arms 
he's got a problem with his power with weapons on patrol 
he's got to walk a fine line and keep his self-control 
trying to save the day for the old world man 
trying to pave the way for the third world man 
he's not concerned with yesterday he knows constant change is here today 
he's noble enough to know what's right but weak enough not to choose it 
he's wise enough to win the world but fool enough to lose it
losing it
the dancer slows her frantic pace in pain and desperation, 
her aching limbs and downcast face aglow with perspiration 
stiff as wire, her lungs on fire, with just the briefest pause
the flooding through her memory, the echoes of old applause 
she limps across the floor and closes her bedroom door 
the writer stares with glassy eyes - defies the empty page
his beard is white, his face is lined and streaked with tears of rage 
thirty years ago, how the words would flow with passion and precision
but now his mind is dark and dulled by sickness and indecision 
and he stares out the kitchen door where the sun will rise no more 
some are born to move the world - to live their fantasies 
but most of us just dream about the things we'd like to be 
sadder still to watch it die than never to have known it 
for you - the blind who once could see - the bell tolls for thee 
countdown
lit up with anticipation we arrive at the launching site 
the sky is still dark, nearing dawn on the florida coastline 
circling choppers slash the night with roving searchlight beams 
this magic day when super-science mingles with the bright stuff of dreams 
floodlit in the hazy distance the star of this unearthly show 
venting vapours, like the breath of a sleeping white dragon 
crackling speakers, voices tense resume the final count 
all systems check, t minus nine as the sun and the drama start to mount 
the air is charged - a humid, motionless mass 
the crowds and the cameras, the cars full of spectators pass 
excitement so thick - you could cut it with a knife
technology - high, on the leading edge of life 
the earth beneath us starts to tremble with the spreading of a low black cloud 
a thunderous roar shakes the air like the whole world exploding 
scorching blast of golden fire as it slowly leaves the ground 
tears away with a mighty force the air is shattered by the awesome sound 
like a pillar of cloud, the smoke lingers high in the air 
in fascination - with the eyes of the world we stare
distant early warning
an ill wind comes arising across the cities of the plain 
there's no swimming in the heavy water no singing in the acid rain 
red alert 
it's so hard to stay together passing through revolving doors 
we need someone to talk to and someone to sweep the floors
incomplete 
the world weighs on my shoulders but what am i to do? 
you sometimes drive me crazy - but i worry about you 
i know it makes no difference to what you're going through 
but i see the tip of the iceberg - and i worry about you 
cruising under your radar watching from satellites 
take a page from the red book - keep them in your sights 
red alert 
left and rights of passage black and whites of youth 
who can face the knowledge that the truth is not the truth? 
obsolete absolute absalom 
afterimage
suddenly - you were gone from all the lives you left your mark upon 
i remember - how we talked and drank into the misty dawn 
i hear the voices 
we ran by the water on the wet summer lawn 
i see the foot prints 
i remember
i feel the way you would 
tried to believe but you know it's no good 
this is something that just can't be understood 
the shouts of joy skiing fast through the woods 
i hear the echoes 
i learned your love for life i feel the way that you would 
i feel your presence - i remember
this just can't be understood 
red sector a
all that we can do is just survive 
all that we can do to help ourselves is stay alive 
ragged lines of ragged grey skeletons, they shuffle away 
shouting guards and smoking guns will cut down the unlucky ones 
i clutch the wire fence until my fingers bleed 
a wound that will not heal - a heart that cannot feel
hoping that the horror will recede 
hoping that tomorrow - we'll all be freed 
sickness to insanity prayer to profanity 
days and weeks and months go by 
don't feel the hunger - too weak to cry 
i hear the sound of gunfire at the prison gate 
are the liberators here - do i hope or do i fear? 
for my father and my brother, it's too late 
but i must help my mother stand up straight 
are we the last ones left alive? 
are we the only human beings to survive? 
the enemy within
things crawl in the darkness that imagination spins 
needles at your nerve ends crawl like spiders on your skin 
pounding in your temples and a surge of adrenaline 
every muscle tense - to fence the enemy within 
i'm not giving in to security under pressure 
i'm not missing out on the promise of adventure 
i'm not giving up on implausible dreams
experience to extremes
suspicious-looking stranger flashes you a dangerous grin 
shadows across your window - was it only trees in the wind? 
every breath a static charge - a tongue that tastes like tin 
steely-eyed outside - to hide the enemy within 
to you - is it movement or is it action? 
it is contact or just reaction? 
and you - revolution or just resistance? 
is it living, or just existence? 
yeah, you - it takes a little more persistence to get up and go the distance 
the body electric
one humanoid escapee one android on the run 
seeking freedom beneath a lonely desert sun 
trying to change its program 
trying to change the mode - crack the code 
images conflicting into data overload 
1-0-0-1-0-0-1 sos 
1-0-0-1-0-0-1 in distress 
1-0-0-1-0-0 
memory banks unloading bytes break into bits 
unit one's in trouble and it's scared out of its wits 
guidance systems break down a struggle to exist - to resist 
a pulse of dying power in a clenching plastic fist 
it replays each of the days a hundred years of routines 
bows its head and prays to the mother of all machines 
kid gloves
a world of difference a world so out of touch 
overwhelmed by everything but wanting more so much
call it blind frustration call it blind man's bluff 
call each other names - your voices rude - your voices rough 
then you learn the lesson that it's cool to be so tough 
handle with kid gloves 
then you learn the lessons taught in school won't be enough 
put on your kid gloves 
a world of indifference heads and hearts too full 
careless of the consequence of constant push and pull 
anger got bare knuckles anger play the fool 
anger wear a crown of thorns reverse the golden rule 
then you learn the lesson that it's tough to be so cool 
then you learn the weapons and the ways of hard-knock school 
then you learn the lesson that it's tough to be so cool 
red lenses
i see red it hurts my head 
guess it must be something that i read 
it's the colour of your heartbeat a rising summer sun 
the battle lost - or won 
the flash to fashion and the pulse to passion
feels red inside my head 
and truth is often bitter - left unsaid 
said red red thinking about the overhead
the underfed - couldn't we talk about something else instead? 
we've got mars on the horizon says the national midnight star 
it's true
what you believe is what you are 
a pair of dancing shoes - the soviets are the blues
the reds under your bed 
lying - in the darkness dead ahead 
and the mercury is rising barometer starts to fall 
you know it gets to us all 
the pain that is learning and the rain that is burning
feel red still - go ahead 
you see black and white - and i see red - not blue
between the wheels
to live between a rock and a hard place 
in between time
cruising in prime time - soaking up the cathode rays 
to live between the wars in our time
living in real time
holding the good time - holding on to yesterdays 
you know how that rabbit feels going under your speeding wheels 
bright images flashing by like windshields towards a fly 
frozen in the fatal climb - but the wheels of time - just pass you by 
wheels can take you around wheels can cut you down 
we can go from boom to bust from dreams to a bowl of dust 
we can fall from rockets' red glare 
down to brother can you spare - another war
another waste land and another lost generation 
it slips between your hands like water 
this living in real time 
a dizzying lifetime reeling by on celluloid 
struck between the eyes by the big-time world 
walking uneasy streets
hiding beneath the sheets - got to try and fill the void
the big money
big money goes around the world 
big money underground 
big money got a mighty voice 
big money make no sound 
big money pull a million strings 
big money hold the prize 
big money weave a mighty web 
big money draw the flies 
sometimes pushing people around 
sometimes pulling out the rug 
sometimes pushing all the buttons 
sometimes pulling out the plug 
it's the power and the glory 
it's a war in paradise 
it's a cinderella story on a tumble of the dice 
big money take a cruise 
big money leave a mighty wake 
big money leave a bruise 
big money make a million dreams 
big money spin big deals 
big money make a mighty head 
big money spin big wheels 
sometimes building ivory towers 
sometimes knocking castles down 
sometimes building you a stairway - lock you underground 
it's that old-time religion 
it's the kingdom they would rule 
it's the fool on television getting paid to play the fool 
big money give and take 
big money done a power of good 
big money make mistakes 
big money got a heavy hand 
big money take control 
big money got a mean streak 
big money got no soul 
grand designs
a to b - different degrees 
so much style without substance so much stuff without style 
it's hard to recognize the real thing it comes along once in a while 
like a rare and precious metal beneath a ton of rock 
it takes some time and trouble to separate from the stock 
you sometimes have to listen to a lot of useless talk 
shapes and forms against the norms
against the run of the mill swimming against the stream 
life in two dimensions is a mass production scheme 
so much poison in power the principles get left out 
so much mind on the matter the spirit gets forgotten about 
like a righteous inspiration overlooked in haste 
like a teardrop in the ocean a diamond in the waste 
some world-views are spacious - and some are merely spaced 
against the run of the mill static as it seems 
we break the surface tension with our wild kinetic dreams 
curves and lines - of grand designs 
manhattan project
imagine a time when it all began 
in the dying days of a war a weapon - that would settle the score 
whoever found it first would be sure to do their worst - they always had before 
imagine a man where it all began 
a scientist pacing the floor in each nation - always eager to explore 
to build the best big stick to turn the winning trick - but this was something more 
the big bang - took and shook the world shot down the rising sun 
the end was begun - it would hit everyone when the chain reaction was done 
the big shots - try to hold it back fools try to wish it away 
the hopeful depend on a world without end whatever the hopeless may say 
imagine a place where it all began 
they gathered from across the land to work in the secrecy of the desert sand 
all of the brightest boys to play with the biggest toys - more than they bargained for 
imagine a man when it all began 
the pilot of "enola gay" flying out of the shockwave on that august day 
all the powers that be and the course of history, would be changed for evermore 
marathon
it's not how fast you can go the force goes into the flow 
if you pick up the beat you can forget about the heat 
more than just survival more than just a flash 
more than just a dotted line more than just a dash 
it's a test of ultimate will the heartbreak climb uphill 
got to pick up the pace if you want to stay in the race 
more than just blind ambition more than just simple greed 
more than just a finish line must feed this burning need - in the long run 
from first to last the peak is never passed 
something always fires the light that gets in your eyes 
one moment's high and glory rolls on by 
like a streak of lightening that flashes and fades in the summer sky 
your meters may overload you can rest at the side of the road 
you can miss a stride but nobody gets a free ride 
more than high performance more than just a spark 
more than just the bottom line or a lucky shot in the dark - in the long run 
you can do a lot in a lifetime if you don't burn out too fast 
you can make the most of the distance
first you need endurance - first you've got to last 
territories
i see the middle kingdom between heaven and earth like the chinese call the country of their birth 
we all figure that our homes are set above other people than the ones we know and love 
in every place with a name they play the same territorial game 
hiding behind the lines sending up warning signs 
the whole wide world an endless universe 
yet we keep looking through the eyeglass in reverse 
don't feed the people but we feed the machines 
can't really feel what international means 
in different circles we keep holding our ground 
indifferent circles we keep spinning round and round 
we see so many tribes - overrun and undermined 
while their invaders dream of lands they've left behind 
better people - better food - and better beer 
why move around the world when eden was so near? 
the bosses get talking so tough and if that wasn't evil enough 
we get the drunken and passionate pride of the citizens along for the ride 
they shoot without shame in the name of a piece of dirt 
for a change of accent or the colour of your shirt 
better the pride that resides in a citizen of the world 
than the pride that divides when a colourful rag is unfurled 
middletown dreams
the office door closed early the hidden bottle came out 
the salesman turned to close the blinds a little slow now, a little stout 
but he's still heading down those tracks any day now for sure 
another day as drab as today is more than a man can endure 
dreams flow across the heartland feeding on the fires 
dreams transport desires drive you when you're down
dreams transport the ones who need to get out of town 
the boy walks with his best friend through the fields of early may 
they walk awhile in silence one close - one far away 
but he'd be climbing on that bus just him and his guitar 
to blaze across the heavens like a brilliant shooting star 
the middle-aged madonna calls her neighbour on the phone 
day by day the seasons pass and leave her life alone 
but she'll go walking out that door on some bright afternoon 
to go and paint big cities from a lonely attic room 
it's understood by every single person 
who'd be elsewhere if they could so far so good 
and life's not unpleasant in their little neighbourhood 
they dream in middletown 
emotion detector
when we lift the covers from our feelings we expose our insecure spots 
trust is just as rare as devotion - forgive us our cynical thoughts 
if we need too much attention - not content with being cool 
we must throw ourselves wide open and start acting like a fool 
if we need too much approval then the cuts can seem too cruel 
right to the heart of the matter right to the beautiful part 
illusions are painfully shattered right where discovery starts 
in the secret wells of emotion buried deep in our hearts 
it's true that love can change us but never quite enough 
sometimes we are too tender sometimes we're too tough 
if we get too much attention it gets hard to overrule 
so often fragile power turns to scorn and ridicule 
sometimes our big splashes are just ripples in the pool 
feelings run high
mystic rhythms
so many things i think about when i look far away 
things i know - things i wonder things i'd like to say 
the more we think we know about the greater the unknown 
we suspend our disbelief and we are not alone
mystic rhythms - capture my thoughts and carry them away 
mysteries of night rscape the light of day 
mystic rhythms - under northern lights or the african sun 
primitive things stir the hearts of everyone 
we sometimes catch a window a glimpse of what's beyond 
was it just imagination stringing us along? 
more things than are dreamed about unseen and unexplained 
we suspend our disbelief and we are entertained
nature seems to spin a supernatural way 
mystic rhythms - under city lights or a canopy of stars 
we feel the powers and we wonder what they are 
we feel the push and pull of restless rhythms from afar
force ten
tough times demand tough talk 
demand tough hearts demand tough songs demand
we can rise and fall like empires flow in and out like the tide 
be vain and smart, humble and dumb we can hit and miss like pride 
we can circle around like hurricanes dance and dream like lovers 
attack the day like birds of prey or scavengers under cover 
look in - to the eye of the storm 
look out - for the force without form 
look around - at the sight and the sound 
look in look out look around
we can move with savage grace to the rhythms of the night 
cool and remote like dancing girls in the heat of the beat and the lights 
we can wear the rose of romance an air of joie de vivre 
too-tender hearts upon our sleeves or skin as thick as thieves' 
rising falling at force ten we twist the world and ride the wind 
look in - look the storm in the eye 
look out - to the sea and the sky 
time stand still
i turn my back to the wind to catch my breath, before i start off again 
driven on without a moment to spend 
to pass an evening with a drink and a friend 
i let my skin get too thin
i'd like to pause, no matter what i pretend 
like some pilgrim - who learns to transcend
learns to live as if each step was the end 
i'm not looking back - but i want to look around me now 
see more of the people and the places that surround me now 
freeze this moment a little bit longer 
make each sensation a little bit stronger 
experience slips away 
i turn my face to the sun 
close my eyes, let my defences down
all those wounds that i can't get unwound 
i let my past go too fast 
no time to pause - if i could slow it all down 
like some captain, whose ship runs aground
i can wait until the tide comes around 
make each impression a little bit stronger 
freeze this motion a little bit longer 
the innocence slips away 
summer's going fast - nights growing colder 
children growing up - old friends growing older 
open secrets
it went right by me - at the time it went over my head 
i was looking out the window i should have looked at your face instead 
it went right by me - just another wall 
there should have been a moment when we let our barriers fall 
i never meant what you're thinking - that is not what i meant at all 
well i guess we all have these feelings we can't leave unreconciled 
some of them burned on our ceilings some of them learned as a child 
the things that we're concealing will never let us grow 
time will do its healing you've got to let it go 
closed for my protection - open to your scorn 
between these two directions my heart is sometimes torn 
i lie awake with my secrets spinning around my head 
something that somehow escaped me
something you shouldn't have said 
i was looking out the window i should have looked at your face instead 
i find no absolution in my rational point of view 
maybe some things are instinctive but there's one thing you could do 
you could try to understand me - i could try to understand you 
second nature
a memo to a higher office open letter to the powers-that-be 
to a god, a king, a head of state a captain of industry 
to the movers and the shakers - can't everybody see? 
it ought to be second nature - i mean, the places where we live! 
let's talk about this sensibly - we're not insensitive 
i know progress has no patience - but something's got to give 
i know you're different - you know i'm the same 
we're both too busy to be taking the blame 
i'd like some changes but you don't have the time 
we can't go on thinking it's a victimless crime 
no one is blameless, but we're all without shame 
we fight the fire while we're feeding the flames 
folks have got to make choices - and choices got to have voices 
folks are basically decent conventional wisdom would say 
well, we read about the exceptions in the papers every day 
it ought to be second nature - at least, that's what i feel 
now i lay me down in dreamland - i know perfect's not for real 
i thought we might get closer - but i'm ready to make a deal 
today is different, and tomorrow the same 
it's hard to take the world the way that it came 
too many rapids keep us sweeping along 
too many captains keep on steering us wrong 
it's hard to take the heat - it's hard to lay blame 
to fight the fire - while we're feeding the flames 
prime mover
basic elemental instinct to survive 
stirs the higher passions thrill to be alive 
alternating currents in a tidewater surge 
rational resistance to an unwise urge 
anything can happen 
from the point of conception to the moment of truth 
at the point of surrender to the burden of proof 
from the point of ignition to the final drive 
the point of the journey is not to arrive 
basic temperamental filters on our eyes 
alter our perceptions lenses polarize 
alternating currents force a show of hands 
rational responses force a change of plans 
from a point on the compass to magnetic north 
the point of the needle moving back and forth 
from the point of entry - until the candle is burned 
the point of departure - is not to return 
i set the wheels in motion turn up all the machines 
activate the programs and run behind the scene 
i set the clouds in motion turn up light and sound 
activate the window and watch the world go 'round
lock and key
i don't want to face the killer instinct - face it in your or me 
we carry a sensitive cargo below the waterline
ticking like a time bomb with a primitive design 
behind the finer feelings - this civilized veneer
the heart of a lonely hunter guards a dangerous frontier 
the balance can sometimes fail - strong emotions can tip the scale
don't want to silence a desperate voice for the sake of security 
no one wants to make a terrible choice on the price of being free 
i don't want to face the killer instinct - face it in you or me 
so we keep it under lock and key 
it's not a matter of mercy it's not a matter of laws 
plenty of people will kill you for some fanatical cause 
it's not a matter of conscience - a search for probable cause 
it's just a matter of instinct - a matter of fatal flaws 
no reward for resistance no assistance - no applause 
we don't want to be victims on that we all agree 
so we lock up the killer instinct - and throw away the key 
mission
hold your fire - keep it burning bright 
hold the flame 'til the dream ignites
a spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission 
i hear their passionate music 
read the words that touch my heart 
i gaze at their feverish pictures the secrets that set them apart 
when i feel the powerful visions their fire has made alive 
i wish i had that instinct - i wish i had that drive 
spirits fly on dangerous missions imaginations on fire 
focused high on soaring ambitions consumed in a single desire 
in the grip of a nameless possession
a slave to the drive of obsession
a spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission 
i watch their images flicker bringing light to a lifeless screen 
i walk through their beautiful buildings and i wish i had their dreams 
but dreams don't need to have motion to keep their spark alive 
obsession has to have action - pride turns on the drive 
it's cold comfort to the ones without it 
to know how they struggled - how they suffered about it 
if their lives were exotic and strange 
they would likely have gladly exchanged them 
for something a little more plain maybe something a little more sane 
we each pay a fabulous price for our visions of paradise 
but a spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission 
turn the page
nothing can survive in a vacuum no one can exists all alone 
we pretend things only happen to strangers 
we've all got problems of our own 
it's enough to learn to share our pleasures 
we can't sooth pain with sympathy 
all that we can do is be reminded - we shake our heads at the tragedy 
every day we're standing in a time capsule 
racing down a river from the past
every day we're standing in a wind tunnel 
facing down the future coming fast 
it's just the age it's just a stage
we disengage - we turn the page 
looking at the long-range forecast 
catching all the names in the news
checking out the state of the nation 
learning the environmental blues 
truth is after all a moving target 
hairs to split and pieces that don't fit 
how can anybody be enlightened? 
truth is after all so poorly lit 
tai shan
high on the sacred mountain up the seven thousand stairs 
in the golden light of autumn there was magic in the air 
clouds surrounded the summit the wind blew strong and cold 
among the silent temples and the writing carved in gold 
somewhere in my instincts the primitive took hold 
i stood at the top of the mountain and china sang to me 
in the peaceful haze of harvest time a song of eternity
if you raise your hands to heaven you will live a hundred years 
i stood there like a mystic lost in the atmosphere 
the clouds were suddenly parted for a moment i could see 
the patterns of the landscape reaching to the eastern sea 
i looked upon a presence spanning forty centuries 
i thought of time and distance the hardships of history 
i heard the hope and the hunger when china sang to me 
high water
when the waters rose in the darkness in the wake of the endless flood 
it flowed into our memory - it flowed into our blood
when something broke the surface just to see the starry dome
we still feel that relation when the water takes us home 
in the flying spray of the ocean the water takes you home
springing from the weight of the mountains 
like the heart of the earth would burst 
flowing out from marble fountains in the dreams of a desert thirst 
something swam through the jungles where the mighty rivers roam
something breaks the silence when the water takes you home 
i hear the wordless voices when the water takes me home - 
waves that crash on the shoreline 
torrents of tropical rain 
streaming down beyond our memory streaming down inside our veins 
when something left the ocean to crawl high above the foam
we still feel that elation when the water takes us home 
in a driving rain of redemption the water takes me home
show don't tell
how many times do you hear it? 
it goes on all day long 
everyone knows everything and no one's ever wrong 
until later 
who can you believe? 
it's hard to play it safe 
but apart from a few good friends we don't take anything on faith 
show don't tell 
show me don't tell me 
you've figured out the score 
i've heard it all before 
i don't care what you say 
you can twist perceptions 
reality won't budge 
you can raise objections 
i will be the judge and the jury 
i'll give it due reflection 
watching from the fence 
give the jury direction based on the evidence 
i, the jury 
hey - order in the court 
let's try to keep it short 
enough of your demands 
witness take the stand 
let's see exhibit a 
chain lightning
energy is contagious 
enthusiasm spreads 
tides respond to lunar gravitation 
everything turns in synchronous relation 
laughter is infectious 
excitement goes to my head 
winds are stirred by planets in rotation 
sparks ignite and spread new information 
respond, vibrate, feed back, resonate 
sun dogs fire on the horizon 
meteor rain stars across the night 
this moment may be brief but it can be so bright 
hope is epidemic 
optimism spreads 
bitterness breeds irritation 
ignorance breeds imitation 
reflected in another source of light 
when the moment dies the spark still flies 
reflected in another pair of eyes 
dreams are sometimes catching 
desire goes to my head 
love responds to your invitation 
love responds to imagination 
the pass
proud swagger out of the schoolyard 
waiting for the world's applause 
rebel without a conscience 
martyr without a cause 
static on your frequency 
electrical storm in your veins 
raging at unreachable glory 
straining at invisible chains 
and now you're trembling on a rocky ledge 
staring down into a heartless sea 
can't face life on a razor's edge 
nothing's what you thought it would be 
all of us get lost in the darkness 
dreamers learn to steer by the stars 
all of us do time in the gutter 
dreamers turn to look at the cars 
turn around and turn around and turn around 
turn around and walk the razor's edge 
don't turn your back and slam the door on me 
it's not as if this barricade blocks the only road 
it's not as if you're all alone in wanting to explode 
someone set a bad example made surrender seem all right 
the act of a noble warrior who lost the will to fight 
done with life on a razor's edge 
no hero in your tragedy 
no daring in your escape 
no salutes for your surrender 
nothing noble in your fate 
war paint
girl before the mirror appraises her disguise 
child become a mother tries to fix her eyes 
no more of his excuses it has to be today 
she can keep her fantasy if she can get away 
paint her name on a one-way street 
painted cheeks with angry heat 
wounded pride on painted eyes 
paint the night with battlecries 
all puffed up with vanity we see what we want to see 
to the beautiful and the wise the mirror always lies 
boy before the mirror checks his camoflauge 
polishes his armor and the charger in the garage 
no more lame excuses it has to be tonight 
he can take the princess if he can take the fight 
pound the drums with martial beat 
pound the streets with marching feet 
wounded pride, distorted eyes 
to the powerful and the wise the mirror always lies 
boys and girls together mistake conceit for pride 
ambition for illusion - dreams for self-delusion 
girls and boys together - see what it is we lack 
boys and girls together let's paint the mirror black 
paint it black 
scars
i've stood upon my mountaintop and shouted at the sky 
walked above the pavement with my sense amplified 
i get this feeling 
all my nerves are naked wires tender to the touch 
sometimes super-sensitive but who can care too much? 
scars of pleasure 
scars of pain 
atmospheric changes make them sensitive again 
each emotional injury leaves behind its mark 
sometimes they come tumbling out like shadows in the dark 
when i think about all i have seen and all i'll never see 
when i think about the people who have opened up to me 
snow falls deep around my house and holds the winter light 
i've heard the lions hunting in the serengeti night 
forests turned to factories and river, sea, and sky 
hungry child in the desert and the flies that cloud her eyes 
pleasure leaves a fingerprint as surely as mortal pain 
in memories they resonate and echo back again 
presto
if i could wave my magic wand 
i am made from the dust of the stars and the oceans flow in my veins 
here i hide in the heart of the city 
like a stranger coming out of the rain 
the evening plane rises up from the runway over constellations of light 
i look down into a million houses and wonder what you're doing tonight 
if i could wave my magic wand i'd make everything all right 
i'm not one to believe in magic but i sometimes have a second-sight 
i'm not one with a sense of proportion when my heart still changes overnight 
i had a dream of a winter garden a midnight rendezvous 
silver, blue, and frozen silence what a fool i was for you 
i had a dream of the open water i was swimming away out to sea 
so deep i could never touch bottom what a fool i used to be 
if i could wave my magic wand i'd set everybody free 
i'm not one to go pointing my finger when i radiate more heat than light 
don't ask me i'm just improvising 
my illusion of careless flight 
can't you see my temperature's rising 
i radiate more heat than light 
don't ask me i'm just sympathizing 
my illusions a harmless flight 
superconductor
packaged like a rebel or a hero 
target mass appeal 
to make an audience feel he really means it 
package the illusion of persona 
careful to conceal 
the fact that she's only too real she's got to screen it 
hit you in a soft place a melody so sweet 
a strong and simple beat that you can dance to 
watch his every move - superconductor 
orchestrate illusions - superconductor 
hoping you'll believe 
designing to deceive 
that's entertainment 
he can put a target on the market 
bask in your applause 
reality withdraws 
now he believes it 
the role becomes the actor 
she's addicted to applause 
the stage a world because she never leaves it 
hit you in a soft place with sentimental ease 
they know the fantasies that you romance to 
watch her every move - superconductor 
she can manipulate reactions - superconductor 
pin the donkeys on her tail 
fantasy for sale that's entertainment 
anagram (for mongo)
there's a snake coming out of the darkness 
parade from paradise 
end the need for eden 
chase the dreams of merchandise 
there is tic and toc in atomic 
leaders make a deal 
the cosmic is largely comic 
a con they couldn't conceal 
there is no safe seat at the feast 
take your best stab at the beast 
the night is turning thin 
the saint is turning to sin 
raise the art to resistance 
danger dare to be grand 
pride reduced to humble pie 
diamonds down to sand 
take heart from earth and weather 
the brightness of new birth 
take heart from the harvest 
shave the harvest from the earth 
reasoning is partly insane 
image just an eyeless game 
the night is turning thin 
the saint is turning to sin 
miracles will have their claimers 
more will bow to rome 
he and she are in the house but there's only me at home 
rose is a rose of splendor 
posed to respond in the end 
lonely things like nights, i find, end finer with a friend 
i hear in the rate of her heart 
a tear in the heat of the art 
the night turns thin 
the saint turns to sin 
red tide
nature has some new plague to run in our streets 
history some new wrinkle we are doomed to repeat 
fugitives at the bedroom door 
lovers pause to find an open store 
rain is burning on the forest floor 
and the red tide kisses the shore 
this is not a false alarm this is not a test 
stay out of the sun it only burns my skin 
sky full of poison and the atmosphere's too thin 
bless the sun, the rain no more 
river running like an open sore 
black wind falling to the ocean floor 
and the red tide washes ashore 
nowhere we can fly away 
nowhere we can rest 
the party is disrupted by an uninvited guest 
deadline approaches for the weary land 
it used to be something but we let it run down in our hands 
too late for debate, too bad to ignore 
quiet rebellion leads to open war 
bring a sea-change to the factory floor 
as the red tide covers the shore 
now's the time to turn the tide 
now's the time to fight 
let us not go gently to the endless winter night 
now's the time to make the time while hope is still in sight 
hand over fist
hand over fist paper around the stone 
scissors cut the paper cut the paper to the bone 
scissors cut the paper and the rock must stand alone 
i could disappear into the crowd but not if i keep my head in the clouds 
i could walk away so proud it's easy enough if you don't laugh too loud 
i thought i was okay alone wait for the postman and the telephone 
lost in a world of my own i thought i could run alone 
thought i could run through the night alone 
hand over hand doesn't seem so much 
hand over hand is the strength of the common touch 
you talk as we walk along you never imagined i could be so wrong 
humming your favorite song you know i've hated that song for so long 
how can we ever agree? 
like the rest of the world we grow farther apart 
i swear you don't listen to me 
holding my hand to my heart 
holding my fist to my racing heart 
take a walk outside myself in some exotic land 
greet a passing stranger feel the strength in his hand 
feel the world expand 
i feel my spirit resist but i open up my fist 
lay hand over hand over hand over fist 
available light
the restless wind has seen all things in every kind of light 
rising with the full moon to go howling through the night 
the sleepless wind has heard all things between the sea and sky 
in the canyons of the city you can hear the buildings cry 
oh the wind can carry all the voices of the sea 
oh the wind can carry all the echoes home to me 
run with wind and weather to the music of the sea 
all four winds together can't bring the world to me 
chase the wind around the world 
i want to look at life - in the available light 
play of light a photograph the way i used to be 
some half-forgotten stranger doesn't mean that much to me 
trick of light
moving picture 
moments caught in flight 
make the shadows darker or the colors shine too bright 
oh the light can carry all the visions of the sea 
oh the light can carry all the images to me 
run to light from shadow 
sun gives me no rest 
promise offered in the east broken in the west 
chase the sun around the world 
shadows hide the play of light 
so much i want to see 
i'll go with the wind 
i'll stand in the light
dreamline
he's got a road map of jupiter a radar fix on the stars 
all along the highway she's got a liquid-crystal compass 
a picture book of the rivers under the sahara 
they travel in the time of the prophets 
on a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun 
like lovers and heroes, and the restless part of everyone 
we're only at home when we're on the run 
on the run 
he's got a star map of hollywood 
a list of cheap motels all along the freeway 
she's got a sister out in vegas 
the promise of a decent job far away from her hometown 
they travel on the road to redemption 
a highway out of yesterday - that tomorrow will bring 
like lovers and heroes, birds in the last days of spring 
we're only at home when we're on the wing 
on the wing 
when we are young wandering the face of the earth 
wondering what our dreams might be worth 
learning that we're only immortal - for a limited time 
time is a gypsy caravan 
steals away in the night to leave you stranded in dreamland 
distance is a long-range filter 
memory a flickering light left behind in the heartland 
we travel in the dark of the new moon 
a starry highway traced on the map of the sky 
like lovers and heroes, lonely as the eagle's cry 
we're only at home when we're on the fly 
on the fly 
we travel on the road to adventure 
on a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun 
bravado
if we burn our wings flying too close to the sun 
if the moment of glory is over before it's begun 
if the dream is won - though everything is lost 
we will pay the price, but we will not count the cost 
when the dust has cleared and victory denied 
a summit too lofty river a little too wide 
if we keep our pride - though paradise is lost 
we will pay the price, but we will not count the cost 
and if the music stops there's only the sound of the rain 
all the hope and glory all the sacrifice in vain 
if love remains though everything is lost 
roll the bones
well, you can stake that claim - good work is the key to good fortune 
winners take that praise losers seldom take that blame 
if they don't take that game and sometimes the winner takes nothing 
we draw our own designs but fortune has to make that frame 
we go out in the world and take our chances 
fate is just the weight of circumstances 
that's the way that lady luck dances - roll the bones 
why are we here? because we're here - roll the bones 
why does it happen? because it happens - roll the bones 
faith is cold as ice
why are little ones born only to suffer 
for the want of immunity or a bowl of rice? 
well, who would hold a price on the heads of the innocent children 
if there's some immortal power to control the dice? 
we come into the world and take our chances 
jack - relax 
get busy with the facts 
no zodiacs or almanacs, no maniacs in polyester slacks 
just the facts - gonna kick some gluteus max 
it's a parallax - you dig? 
you move around the small gets big it's a rig 
it's action - reaction - random interaction 
so who's afraid of a little abstraction? 
can't get no satisfaction from the facts? 
you better run, homeboy
a fact's a fact from nome to rome, boy 
what's the deal? spin the wheel 
if the dice are hot - take a shot 
play your cards show us what you got - what you're holding 
if the cards are cold, don't go folding 
lady luck is golden
she favors the bold that's cold 
stop throwing stones - the night has a thousand saxophones 
so get out there and rock, and roll the bones 
get busy! 
face up
you turn my head i spin my wheels 
running on empty - you know how that feels 
i'm on a roll now - or is it a slide? 
can't be too careful with that dangerous pride 
if i could only reach that dial inside and turn it up 
face up - or you can only back down 
face up - hit the target, or you better hit the ground 
face up - there's still time to turn the game around 
face up - turn it up or turn that wild card down 
turn it up 
don't complain don't explain 
i don't think my new resolve can stand the strain 
i'm in a groove now - or is it a rut? 
i need some feedback but all the lines are cut 
i get so angry, but i keep my mouth shut 
and turn it up 
you get all squeezed up inside like the days were carved in stone 
you get all wired up inside and it's bad to be alone 
you can go out, you can take a ride and when you get out on your own 
you get all smoothed out inside and it's good to be alone 
where's my thing?
part iv, gangster of boats trilogy
the big wheel
well, i was only a kid - didn't know enough to be afraid 
playing the game, but not the way the big boys played 
nothing to lose - maybe i had something to trade 
the way the big wheel spins 
well, i was only a kid, on a holy crusade 
i placed no trust in a faith that was ready-made 
take no chances on paradise delayed 
so i do a slow fade 
playing for time don't want to wait for heaven 
looking for love for an angel to forgive my sins 
playing with fire chasing something new to believe in 
looking for love the way the big wheel spins 
well, i was only a kid, cruising around in a trance 
prisoner of fate, victim of circumstance 
i was lined up for glory, but the tickets sold out in advance 
well, i was only a kid, gone without a backward glance 
going for broke, going for another chance 
hoping for heaven - hoping for a fine romance 
if i do the right dance 
wheel goes round, landing on a twist of faith 
taking your chances you'll have the right answers when the final judgment begins 
wheel goes round, landing on a leap of fate 
life redirected in ways unexpected 
sometimes the odd number wins - the way the big wheel spins 
heresy
all around that dull gray world from moscow to berlin 
people storm the barricades walls go tumbling in 
the counter-revolution people smiling through their tears 
who can give them back their lives and all those wasted years? 
all those precious wasted years - who will pay? 
all around that dull gray world of ideology 
people storm the marketplace and buy up fantasy 
the counter-revolution at the counter of a store 
people buy the things they want and borrow for a little more 
all those wasted years - all those precious, wasted years 
who will pay? 
do we have to be forgiving at last? what else can we do? 
do we have to say goodbye to the past? yes, i guess we do 
all around this great big world all the crap we had to take 
bombs and basement fallout shelters all our lives at stake 
the bloody revolution all the warheads in its wake 
all the fear and suffering - all a big mistake 
ghost of a chance
like a million little doorways all the choices we made 
all the stages we passed through all the roles we played 
so many different directions our separate paths might have turned 
with every door that we opened every bridge that we burned 
somehow we find each other through all that masquerade 
somehow we found each other somehow we have stayed in a state of grace 
i don't believe in destiny or the guiding hand of fate 
i don't believe in forever or love as a mystical state 
i don't believe in the stars or the planets or angels watching from above 
but i believe there's a ghost of a chance we can find someone to love and make it last 
like a million little crossroads through the backstreets of youth 
each time we turn a new corner a tiny moment of truth 
so many different connections our separate paths might have made 
with every door that we opened every game we played 
neurotica
you just don't get it what it is  well, you're not really sure 
you move like you're walking on this ice talking like you're still insecure 
time is a spiral - space is a curve 
i know you get dizzy, but try not to lose your nerve 
life is a diamond you turn into dust 
waiting for rescue, and i know you just don't get it 
you just don't get it 
neurotica - exotica 
it's just erotica - hypnotica 
it's just psychotica - chaotica 
it's just exotica - neurotica 
you just don't get it baby, don't you ask yourself why? 
if you don't like the answer - forget it 
you know i hate to see you cry 
fortune is random - fate shoots from the hip 
i know you get crazy, but try not to lose your grip 
life is a diamond you turn into dust 
looking for trust, and i know that you just don't get it 
snap! 
hide in your shell, let the world go to hell 
it's like russian roulette to you 
sweat running cold, you can't face growing old 
it's a personal threat to you 
the world is a cage for your impotent rage 
don't let it get to you 
you bet your life
june another hunter, like a wolf in the sun 
just another junkie on a scoring run 
just another victim of the things he has done 
just another day - in the life of a loaded gun 
the odds get even - you name the game 
the odds get even - the stakes are the same 
you bet your life 
just another winner, pours his life down the drain 
just another island in a hurricane 
just another loser, like a cat in the rain 
just another day - in the path of a speeding train

just another drunk - at the wheel of a stolen car

stick it out

lightning reactions must be carefully trained

don't swallow the poison - spit it out

don't swallow the truth - stick it out 
each time we bathe our reactions in artificial light 
each time we alter the focus to make the wrong moves seem right 
you get so used to deception you make yourself a nervous wreck 
you get so used to surrender running back to cover your neck 
cut to the chase
it is the fire that lights itself but it burns with a restless flame 
the arrow on a moving target the archer must be sure of his aim 
it is the engine that drives itself but it chooses the uphill climb 
a bearing on magnetic north growing farther away all the time 
can't stop - moving 
you may be right it's all a waste of time 
i guess that's just a chance i'm prepared to take 
a danger i'm prepared to face - cut to the chase 
it is the rocket that ignites itself and launches its way to the stars 
a driver on a busy freeway racing the oblivious cars 
it's the motor of the western world spinning off to every extreme 
pure as a lover's desire evil as a murderer's dream 
young enough not to care too much about the way things used to be 
i'm young enough to remember the future - the past has no claim on me 
i'm old enough not to care too much about what you think of me 
but i'm young enough to remember the future and the way things ought to be 
what kind of difference can one person make? 
nobody's hero
hero - saves a drowning child - cures a wasting disease 
hero - lands the crippled airplane - solves great mysteries 
hero - not the handsome actor - who plays a hero's role 
hero - not the glamor girl - who'd love to sell her soul 
if anybody's buying nobody's hero 
try to hold some faith in the goodness of humanity 
hero - the voice of reason - against the howling mob 
hero - the pride of purpose - in the unrewarding job 
hero - not the champion player - who plays the perfect game 
not the glamor boy who loves to sell his name 
everybody's buying nobody's hero

between sun and moon
there is a lake between sun and moon not too many know about 
in the silence between whisper and shout
the space between wonder and doubt 
this is a fine place
shining face to face 
those bonfire lights in the mirror of sky 
the space between wonder and why 
ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes 
why the sun why the sun 
there is a fine line between love and illusion - a fine place to penetrate 
the gap between actor and act 
the lens between wishes and fact 
this is a fine place to hesitate 
those bonfire lights in the lake of sky 
the time between wonder and why 
some need to pray to the sun at high noon 
some need to howl at the midwinter moon 
reborn and baptized in a moment of grace 
we just need a break - from the headlong race 
alien shore
you and i, we are strangers by one chromosome 
slave to the hormone, body and soul 
in a struggle to be happy and free 
swimming in a primitive sea 
you and i, we must dive below the surface 
a world of red neon, and ultramarine 
shining bridges on the ocean floor 
reaching to the alien shore 
for you and me - we agree 
you and i, we are pressed into these solitudes 
color and culture, language and race 
just variations on a theme 
islands in a much larger stream 
for you and me - race is not a competition 
for you and me - race is not a definition 
reaching for the alien shore 
you and i, we reject these narrow attitudes 
we add to each other, like a coral reef 
building bridges on the ocean floor 
reaching for the alien shore 
for you and me - we hold these truths to be self-evident 
for you and me - we'd elect each other president 
for you and me - we might agree - but that's just us 
speed of love
love is born with lightning bolts electro-magnetic force 
burning skin and fireworks a storm on a raging course 
like a force of nature, love can fade with the stars at dawn 
sometimes it takes all your strength just to keep holding on 
at the speed of love a radiance that travels 
at the speed of love my heart goes out to you 
love is born with solar flares from two magnetic poles 
it moves towards a higher plane where two halves make two wholes 
like a force of nature, love shines in many forms 
one night we are bathed in light one day carried away in the storms 
at the speed of love nothing changes faster than the speed of love 
my heart goes out to you 
we don't have to talk we don't even have to touch 
i can feel your prescence in the silence that we share 
got to keep moving at the speed of love 
nothing changes faster than the speed of love 
got to keep on shining at the speed of love 
nothing changes faster than the speed of love 
double agent
where would you rather be? anywhere but here 
when will the time be right? anytime but now 
on the edge of sleep, i was drifting for half the night 
anxious and restless, pressed down by the darkness 
bound up and wound up so tight 
so many decisions, a million revisions 
caught between darkness and light 
wilderness of mirrors world of polished steel 
gears and iron chains turn the grinding wheel 
i run between the shadows - some are phantoms, some are real 
the doubt and the fear i know would all disappear 
on the edge of sleep, i heard voices behind the door 
the known and the nameless, familiar and faceless 
my angels and my demons at war 
which one will lose - depends on what i choose or maybe which voice i ignore 
wilderness of mirrors streets of cold desire 
my precious sense of honor just a shield of rusty wire 
i hold against the chaos - and the cross of holy fire 
wilderness of mirrors so easy to deceive 
my precious sense of rightness is sometimes so naive 
so that which i imagine is that which i believe 
on the edge of sleep, i awoke to a sun so bright 
rested and fearless, cheered by your nearness 
i knew which direction was right 
the case had been tried by the jury inside 
the choice between darkness and light 
leave that thing alone
cold fire
it was long after midnight when we got to unconditional love 
she said sure, my heart is boundless but don't push my limits too far 
i said if love was so transcendant i don't understand these boundaries 
she said just don't disappoint me - you know how complex women are 
i'll be around if you don't let me down too far 
it was just before sunrise when we started on traditional roles 
she said sure i'll be your partner but don't make too many demands 
i said if love has these conditions i don't understand those songs you love 
she said this is not a love song this isn't fantasy-land 
i'll be around if you don't push me down too far 
don't go too far
the phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire 
don't cross the line
the pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire 
don't let me down
the flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire 
don't break the spell
the look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire 
love is blind if you are gentle 
love can turn to a long, cold burn 
everyday glory
in the house where nobody laughs and nobody sleeps 
in the house where love lies dying and the shadows creep 
a little girl hides, shaking, with her hands on her ears 
pushing back the tears, 'til the pain disappears 
mama says some ugly words daddy pounds the wall 
they can fight about their little girl later but right now they don't care at all 
no matter what they say 
everyday people everyday shame 
everyday promise shot down in flames 
everyday sunrise another everyday story 
rise from the ashes - a blaze of everyday glory 
in the city where nobody smiles and nobody dreams 
in the city where desperation drives the bored to extremes 
just one spark of decency against a starless night 
one glow of hope and dignity a child can follow the light 
if the future's looking dark we're the ones who have to shine 
if there's no one in control we're the ones who draw the line 
though we live in trying times - we're the ones who have to try 
though we know that time has wings - we're the ones who have to fly
test for echo
here we go - vertigo 
video vertigo - test for echo 
here we go - in slo-mo 
some kind of trouble on the sensory screen 
camera curves over caved-in cop cars 
bleacher-creatures, would-be desperados 
clutch at plausible deniability 
don't touch that dial
we're in denial until the showcase trial on tv 
some kind of pictures on the sense o'clock news 
miles of yellow tape - silhouetted chalklines 
tough-talking hood boys in pro-team logo knockoffs 
conform to uniforms of some corporate entity 
don't change that station 
it's gangster nation now crime's in syndication on tv 
what a show - vertigo 
touch and go - in slo-mo 
some kind of drama live on satellite 
hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom 
nail-biting hoodboys in borrowed ties and jackets 
clutching at the straws of respectability 
can't do the time? 
don't do the crime and wind up in the perp walk on tv 
driven
driven up and down in circles 
skidding down a road of black ice 
staring in and out storm windows 
driven to a fool's paradise 
but it's my turn to drive 
driven to the margin of error 
driven to the edge of control 
driven to the margin of terror 
driven to the edge of a deep, dark hole 
driven day and night in circles 
spinning like a whirlwind of leaves 
stealing in and out back alleys 
driven to another den of thieves 
driven in - driven to the edge 
driven out - on the thin end of the wedge 
driven off - by things i've never seen 
driven on - by the road to somewhere i've never been 
it's my turn to drive 
the road unwinds towards me what was there is gone 
the road unwinds before me and i go riding on 
half the world
half the world hates what half the world does every day 
half the world waits while half gets on with it anyway 
half the world lives 
half the world makes 
half the world gives while the other half takes 
half the world is 
half the world was 
half the world thinks while the other half does 
half the world talks with half a mind on what they say 
half the world walks with half a mind to run away 
half the world lies 
half the world learns 
half the world flies as half the world turns 
half the world cries 
half the world laughs 
half the world tries to be the other half 
half of us divided like a torn-up photograph 
half of us are trying to reach the other half 
half the world cares while half the world is wasting the day 
half the world shares while half the world is stealing away 
the color of right
i don't have an explanation for another lonely night 
i just feel this sense of mission and the sense of what is right 
take it easy on my now - i'd be there if i could 
i'm so full of what is right i can't see what is good 
it's a hopeless situation lie awake for half the night 
you're not sure what's going on here but you're sure it isn't right 
make it easy on yourself there's nothing more you can do 
you're so full of what is right you can't see what is true 
a quality of justice a quantity of light 
a particle of mercy makes the color of right 
gravity and distance change the passage of light 
gravity and distance change the color of right 
time and motion
time and motion wind and sun and rain 
days connect like boxcars in a train 
fill them up with precious cargo 
squeeze in all that you can find 
spontaneous elation and the long-enduring kind 
time and motion flesh and blood and fire 
lives connect in webs of gold and razor wire 
spin a thread of precious contact 
the mighty ocean dances with the moon 
the silent forest echoes with the loon 
time and motion live and love and dream 
eyes connect like interstellar beams 
superman in supernature needs all the comfort he can find 
spontaneous emotion and the long enduring kind 
totem
i've got twelve disciples and a buddha smile 
the garden of allah - viking valhalla 
a miracle once in a while 
i've got a pantheon of animals in a pagan soul 
vishnu and gaia - aztec and maya dance around my totem pole 
i believe in what i see 
i believe in what i hear 
i believe that what i'm feeling changes how the world appears 
angels and demons dancing in my head 
lunatics and monsters underneath my bed 
media messiahs preying on my fears 
pop culture prophets playing in my ears 
i've got celestial mechanics to synchronize my stars 
seasonal migrations - daily variations 
world of the unlikely and bizarre 
i've got idols and icons, unspoken holy vows 
thoughts to keep well-hidden - sacred and forbidden 
free to browse among the holy cows - that's why i believe 
angels and demons inside of me 
saviors and satans all around me 
sweet chariot, swing low, coming for me 
dog years
in a dog's life a year is really more like seven 
all too soon a canine will be chasing cars in doggie heaven 
dog years - it's the season of the itch 
dog years - with every scratch it reappears 
in the dog days people look to sirius 
dogs cry for the moon but those connections are mysterious 
i'd rather be a tortoise from galapagos or a span of geological time 
in a dog's brain a constant buzz of low-level static 
one sniff at the hydrant and the answer is automatic 
virtuality
like a shipwrecked mariner adrift on an unknown sea 
clinging to the wreckage of the lost ship fantasy 
i'm a castaway, stranded in a desolate land 
i can see the footprints in the virtual sand 
net boy, net girl send your signal 'round the world 
let your fingers walk and talk and set you free 
net boy, net girl send your impulse 'round the world 
put your message in a modem and throw it in the cyber sea 
astronauts in the weightlessness of pixellated space 
exchange graffiti with a disembodied race 
i can save the universe in a grain of sand 
i can hold the future in my virtual hand 
let's dance tonight to a virtual song 
press this key and you can play along 
let's fly tonight on our virtual wings 
press this key to see amazing things 
like a pair of vagabonds who wave between two passing trains 
the glimpse of a woman's smile through a window in the rain 
i can smell her perfume, i can taste her lips 
i can feel the voltage from her fingertips 
net boy, net girl send your heartbeat 'round the world 
resist
i can learn to resist anything but temptation 
i can learn to co-exist with anything but pain 
i can learn to compromise anything but my desires 
i can learn to get along with all the things i can't explain 
i can learn to resist anything but frustration 
i can learn to persist with anything but aiming low 
i can learn to close my eyes to anything but injustice 
i can learn to get along with all the things i don't know 
you can surrender without a prayer but never really pray 
pray without surrender 
you can fight without ever winning but never ever win 
win without a fight 
limbo
whatever happened to my transylvania twist?
mmmm, mash goooood!
carve away the stone
you can roll that stone to the top of the hill 
drag your ball and chain behind you 
you can carry that weight with an iron will 
let the pain remain behind you 
chip away the stone - sisyphus
chip away the stone 
make the burden lighter if you must roll that rock alone 
you can drive those wheels to the end of the road 
you will still find the past right behind you 
try to deny the weight of the load 
try to put the sins of the past night behind you 
carve away the stone - sisyhpus
carve away the stone 
make a graven image with some features of your own 
you can try to deny the weight of the load 
roll away the stone - sisyhpus
roll away the stone 
if you could just move yours i could get working on my own
one little victory
a certain measure of innocence willing to appear naive 
a certain degree of imagination a measure of make-believe 
a certain degree of surrender to the forces of light and heat 
a shot of satisfaction in a willingness to risk defeat 
celebrate the moment as it turns into one more 
another chance at victory another chance to score 
the measure of the moment is a difference of degree 
just one little victory a spirit breaking free 
one little victory the greatest act can be 
a certain measure of righteousness 
a certain amount of force 
a certain degree of determination daring on a different course 
a certain amount of resistance to the forces of the light and love 
a certain measure of tolerance a willingness to rise above 
ceiling unlimited
it's not the heat it's the inhumanity 
plugged into the sweat of a summer street 
machine gun images pass like malice through the looking glass 
the slackjaw gaze of true profanity 
feels more like surrender than defeat 
if culture is the curse of the thinking class 
ceiling unlimited - world so wide 
turn and turn again 
feeling unlimited - still unsatisfied 
changes never end 
the vacant laugh of true insanity 
dressed up in the mask of tragedy 
programmed for the guts and glands of idle minds and idle hands 
i rest my case - or at least my vanity 
dressed up in the mask of comedy 
if laughter is a straw for a drowning man 
ceiling unlimited - windows open wide 
look and look again 
feeling unlimited eyes on the prize 
changes never end 
winding like an ancient river the time is now again 
hope is like an endless river the time is now again 
ghost rider
pack up all those phantoms 
shoulder that invisible load 
keep on riding north and west 
haunting that wilderness road like a ghost rider 
carry all those phantoms through bitter wind and stormy skies 
from the desert to the mountain 
from the lowest low to the highest high 
like a ghost rider 
keep on riding north and west then circle south and east 
show me beauty, but there is no peace for the ghost rider 
shadows on the road behind 
shadows on the road ahead 
nothing can stop you now 
there's a shadow on the road behind 
there's a shadow on the road ahead 
sunrise in the mirror lightens that invisible load 
riding on a nameless quest 
just an escape artist racing against the night 
a wandering hermit racing toward the light 
from the white sands to the canyonlands 
to the redwood stands to the barren lands 
sunrise on the road behind sunset on the road ahead 
there's nothing to stop you now 
peaceable kingdom
a wave toward the clearing the sky 
all this time we're talking and sharing our rational view 
a billion other voices are spreading other news 
all this time we're living and trying to understand 
why a billion other choices are making their demands 
talk of a peaceable kingdom 
talk of a time without fear 
the ones we wish would listen are never going to hear 
justice against the hanged man 
knight of wands against the hour 
swords against the kingdom 
time against the tower 
all this time we're shuffling and laying out all our cards 
while a billion other dealers are slipping past our guards 
all this time we're hoping and praying we all might learn 
while a billion other teachers are teaching them how to burn 
dream of a peaceable kingdom 
dream of a time without war 
the ones we wish would hear us have heard it all before 
a wave toward the clearing sky 
the hermit against the lovers 
the devil against the fool 
swords against the kingdom 
the wheel against the rules 
all this time we're burning like bonfires in the dark 
a billion other blazes are shooting off their sparks 
every spark a drifting ember of desire 
to fall upon the earth and spark another fire 
a homeward angel on the fly 
the stars look down
like the fly on the wheel, who says - what a lot of dust we're raising
are you under the illusion that you're part of this scheme? 
seems like a lifetime ago 
you could look with pride on your world of dreams 
what is the meaning of this? and the stars look down 
what are you trying to do? and the stars look down 
was it something i said? and the stars look down 
like the rat in a maze who says - watch me choose my own direction
are you under the illusion the path is winding your way? 
are you surprised by confusion when it leads you astray? 
have you lived a lifetime today
do you feel like you just got carried away? 
something you'd like me to do? and the stars look down 
how it is
here's a little trap that sometimes catches everyone 
when today's as far as we can see 
faith in bright tomorrows giving way to resignation 
that's how it is - how it's going to be 
it's such a cloudy day 
seems we'll never see the sun or feel the day has possibilities 
frozen in the moment - the lack of imagination 
between how it is and how it ought to be 
here's a little trap that sometimes trips up everyone 
we tire of our own company 
sometimes we're the last to see beyond the day's frustrations 
it's such a cloudy day seems we'll never see the sun 
i feel the day is all uncertainty 
burning in the moment - trapped by the desperation 
between how it is and how it ought to be 
foot upon the stair shoulder to the wheel 
you can't tell yourself not to care 
that's how it is 
another cloudy day 
vapor trail
stratospheric traces of our transitory flight 
trails of condensation held in narrow bands of white 
the sun is turning black the world is turning gray 
all the stars fade from the night the oceans drain away 
horizon to horizon memory written on the wind 
fading away, like an hourglass, grain by grain 
swept away like voices in a hurricane 
in a vapor trail 
atmospheric phases make the transitory last 
vaporize the memories that freeze the fading past 
silence all the songbirds stilled by the killing frost 
forests burn to ashes everything is lost 
washed away like footprints in the rain 
secret touch
the way out is the way in 
out of touch with the weather and the wind direction 
with the sunrise and the phases of the moon 
out of touch with life in the land of the loving 
with the living night and the darkness at high noon 
you can never break the chain 
there is never love without pain 
a gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart 
out of sync with the rhythm of my own reactions 
with the things that last and the things that come apart 
out of sync with love in the land of the living 
a healing hand, a secret touch on the heart 
there is never love without pain 
life is a power that remains 
earthshine
on certain nights 
when the angles are right and the moon is a slender crescent 
its circle shows in a ghostly glow of earthly luminescence 
earthshine a beacon in the night 
i can raise my eyes to earthshine 
earthshine - a jewel out of reach 
form a dream to rise to earthshine 
floating high in the evening sky 
i see my faint reflection 
pale facsimile 
like what others see when they look in my direction 
earthshine - stretching out your hand 
full of starlit diamonds earthshine 
reflected light 
to another's sight and the moon tells a lover's story 
my borrowed face and my third-hand grace only reflect your glory 
you're still out of reach 
form a dream to rise to earthshine 
sweet miracle
i wasn't walking on water 
i was standing on a reef when the tide came in 
swept beneath the surface lost without a trace 
no hope at all 
oh - sweet miracle 
oh - sweet miracle of life 
i wasn't walking with angels 
i was talking to myself 
rising up to the surface 
raging against the night
starless night 
love's sweet miracle of life 
oh salvation 
i wasn't praying for magic 
i was hiding in plain sight 
rising up from the surface to fly into the light 
nocturne
did i have a dream? or did the dream have me? 
set off on a night-sea journey without memory or desire 
drifting through lost latitudes with no compass and no chart 
flying through hallucination distant voices, signal fires 
lighting up my unconscious and the secret places of the heart 
dream - temporary madness 
dream - a voice in the wilderness 
dream - unconscious revelations 
the morning says, the answer is yes 
floating through a darkened mirror 
deep reflections in disguise 
soaring through lost altitudes 
without wonder, without fear 
symbols on a field of visions 
behind the curtain of sleeping eyes 
on the instant of waking another world of dreams appears 
dream - a walk in the wilderness 
dream - unconscious recreation 
freeze
the city crouches, steaming in the early morning half-light 
the sun is still a rumor and the night is still a threat 
slipping through the dark streets and the echoes and the shadows 
something stirs behind me and my palms begin to sweat 
sometimes i freeze - until the light comes 
sometimes i fly - into the night 
sometimes i fight - against the darkness 
sometimes i'm wrong - sometimes i'm right 
coiled for the spring or caught like a creature in the headlights 
into a desperate panic or a tempest of blind fury 
like a cornered beast or a conquering hero 
the menace threatens, closing and i'm frozen in the shadows 
i'm not prepared to run away and i'm not prepared to fight 
i can't stand to reason or surrender to a reflex 
i will trust my instincts or surrender to my fright 
sometimes we freeze - until the light comes 
sometimes we're wrong - and sometimes we're right 
sometimes we fight - against the darkness 
sometimes we fly - into the night 
blood running cold mind going down into a dark night 
of a desperate panic or a tempest of blind fury 
sometimes i freeze 
sometimes i fight 
sometimes i fly into the night 
out of the cradle
it's not a place 
it's a yearning 
it's not a race 
it's a journey 
it's not an act 
it's attraction 
it's not a style 
it's an action 
it's a dream for the waking 
it's a flower touched by flame 
it's a gift for the giving 
it's a power with a hundred names 
surge of energy, spark of inspiration 
the breath of love is electricity 
maybe time is bird in flight 
endlessly mocking 
here we come out of the cradle 
endlessly rocking 
it's a hand that rocks the cradle 
it's a motion that swings the sky 
it's method on the edge of madness 
it's a balance on the edge of a knife 
it's a smile on the edge of sadness 
it's a dance on the edge of life 
far cry
pariah dogs and wandering madmen 
barking at strangers and speaking in tongues 
the ebb and flow of tidal fortune 
electrical changes are charging up the young 
it's a far cry from the world we thought we'd inherit 
it's a far cry from the way we thought we'd share it 
you can almost feel the current flowing 
you can almost see the circuits blowing 
one day i feel i'm on top of the world and the next it's falling in on me 
i can get back on 
one day i feel i'm ahead of the wheel and the next it's rolling over me 
whirlwind life of faith and betrayal 
rise in anger, fall back and repeat 
slow degrees on the dark horizon 
full moon rising, lays silver at your feet 
you can almost see the circle growing 
you can almost feel the planets glowing 
one day i fly through a crack in the sky and the next it's falling in on me 
armor and sword
the snakes and arrows a child is heir to are enough to leave a thousand cuts 
we build our defenses, a place of safety and leave the darker places unexplored 
sometimes the fortress is too strong or the love is too weak 
what should have been our armor becomes a sharp and angry sword 
our better natures seek elevation 
a refuge for the coming night 
no one gets to their heaven without a fight 
we hold beliefs as a consolation a way to take us out of ourselves 
meditation, or medication a comfort, or a promised reward 
sometimes that spirit is too strong or the flesh is too weak 
sometimes the need is just too great for the solace we seek 
the suit of shining armor becomes a keen and bloody sword 
a future of eternal light 
confused alarms of struggle and flight 
blood is drained of color by the flashes of artillery light 
the battle flags are flown at the feet of a god unknown 
sometimes the damage is too great or the will is too weak 
what should have been our armor becomes a sharp and burning sword 
workin' them angels
driving away to the east, and into the past 
history recedes in my rear-view mirror 
carried away on a wave of music down a desert road 
memory humming at the heart of a factory town 
all my life i've been workin' them angels overtime 
riding and driving and living so close to the edge 
workin' them angels - overtime 
riding through the range of light to the wounded city 
filling my spirit with the wildest wish to fly 
taking the high road to the wounded city 
memory strumming at the heart of a moving picture 
all this time i've been working them angels overtime 
riding and driving and flying just over the edge 
driving down the razor's edge between the past and the future 
turn up the music and smile 
get carried away on the songs and stories of vanished times 
memory drumming at the heart of an english winter 
memories beating at the heart of an african village 
the larger bowl
a pantoum
if we're so much the same, like i always hear why such different fortunes and fates? 
some of us live in a cloud of fear some live behind iron gates 
why such different fortunes and fates? 
some are blessed and some are cursed 
some live behind iron gates while others see only the worst 
the golden one or scarred from birth 
while others only see the worst 
such a lot of pain on the earth 
some things can never be changed 
it's somehow so badly arranged 
some reasons will never come clear 
it's somehow so badly arranged 
if we're so much the same, like i always hear 
spindrift
as the waves crash in on the western shore 
the wind blows fierce from the east 
wavetops torn into flying spindrift 
as the waves crash in on the western shore 
it makes me feel uneasy 
the spray that's torn away is an image of the way i feel 
what am i supposed to say? 
where are the words to answer you when you talk that way? 
as the sun goes down on the western shore 
the wind blows hard from the east 
it whips the sand into a flying spindrift 
as the sun goes down on the western shore 
it makes me feel uneasy 
in the hot dry rasp of the devil winds 
who cares what a fool believes? 
where are the words to answer you when you talk that way? 
words that fly against the wind and waves 
a little closer to you
where is the wave that will carry me a little closer to you? 
what am i supposed to do? 
where are the words that will make you see what i believe is true? 
the main monkey business
the way the wind blows
now it's come to this 
it's like we're back in the dark ages 
from the middle east to the middle west 
it's a world of superstition 
wide-eyed armies of the faithful 
pray, and pass the ammunition 
so many people think that way 
you gotta watch what you say to them and them, and others too 
who don't seem to see things the way you do 
we can only grow the way the wind blows 
on a bare and weathered shore 
we can only bow to the here and now in our elemental war 
we can only bow to the here and now or be broken down blow by blow 
hollow speeches of mass deception 
like crusaders in unholy alliance 
like we're back in the dark ages 
it's a plague that resists all science 
it seems to leave them partly blind and they leave no child behind 
while evil spirits haunt their sleep 
while shepherds bless and count their sheep 
like a solitary pine on a bare wind-blasted shore 
hope
faithless
i've got my own moral compass to steer by 
a guiding star beats a spirit in the sky 
all the preaching voices
empty vessels ring so loud as they move among the crowd 
fools and thieves are well disguised in the temple and marketplace 
like a stone in the river against the floods of spring 
i will quietly resist 
like the willows in the wind or the cliffs along the ocean 
i don't have faith in faith 
i don't believe in belief 
you can call me faithless but i still cling to hope 
i believe in love and that's faith enough for me 
i've got my own spirit level for balance 
to tell if my choice is leading up or down 
all the shouting voices try to throw me off my course 
some by sermons, some by force 
fools and thieves are dangerous in the temple and marketplace 
like a forest bows to winter beneath the deep white silence 
like a flower in the desert that only blooms at night 
bravest face
though we might have precious little it's still precious 
i like that song about this wonderful world 
it's got a sunny point of view and sometimes i feel it's true 
at least for a few of us 
i like that world it makes a wonderful song 
but there's a darker point of view 
that's sadly just as true for so many among us 
in the sweetest child there's a vicious streak 
in the strongest man there's a child so weak 
in the whole wide world there's no magic place 
so you might as well rise, put on your bravest face 
i like that show where they solve all the murders 
that heroic point of view 
it's got justice and vengeance too at least, so the story goes 
i like that story - makes a satisfying case 
but there's a messy point of view 
that's sadly just as true for so many among us 
in the softest voice there's an acid tongue 
in the oldest eyes there's a soul so young 
in the shakiest will there's a core of steel 
on the smoothest ride there's a squeaky wheel 
good news first
the best we can agree on is it could have been worse 
what happened to your old benevolent universe' 
you know the one with stars that revolve around you 
beaming down full of promises to bring good news 
you used to feel that way the saddest words you could ever say 
but i know you'll remember that day and the most beautiful words i could ever say 
the worst thing about it all is that you might have been right 
and i'm still not really sure what started that fight 
but i still get this feeling there's more trouble ahead 
so never mind the bad news let's have the good news instead 
some would say they never fear a thing well i do 
and i'm afraid enough for both of us - for me and you 
time, if nothing else, will do its worst 
so do me that favor and tell me the good news first 
malignant narcissism
usually a case of malignant narcissism brought on during childhood
we hold on
how many times do we tire of all the little battles 
threaten to call it quits tempted to cut and run 
how many times do we weather out the stormy evenings 
long to slam the front door drive away into the setting sun 
keep going until dawn 
how many times must another line be drawn 
we could be down and gone but we hold on 
how many times do we chafe against the repetition 
straining against a fate measured out in coffee breaks 
how many times do we swallow our ambitions 
long to give up the same old way find another road to take 
keep holding on so long 
'cause there's a chance that we might not be so wrong 
how many times do we wonder if it's even worth it 
there's got to be some other way to get me through the days 
but we hold on
caravan
in a world lit only by fire 
long train of flares under piercing stars 
i stand watching the steamliners roll by 
the caravan thunders onward to the distant dream of the city 
the caravan carries me onward on my way at last 
on my way at last 
i can't stop thinking big 
on a road lit only by fire 
going where i want, instead of where i should 
i peer out at the passing shadows 
carried through the night into the city 
where a young man has a chance of making good 
a chance to break from the past 
the caravan thunders onward 
stars winking through the canvas hood 
in a world where i feel so small i can't stop thinking big 
bu2b
i was brought up to believe the universe has a plan 
we are only human it's not ours to understand 
the universe has a plan all is for the best 
some will be rewarded and the devil take the rest 
all is for the best believe in what we're told 
blind men in the market buying what we're sold 
believe in what we're told until our final breath 
while our loving watchmaker loves us all to death 
in a world of cut and thrust i was always taught to trust 
in a world where all must fail heaven's justice will prevail 
the joy and pain that we receive each comes with its own cost 
the price of what we're winning is the same as what we've lost 
until our final breath the joy and pain that we receive 
must be what we deserve i was brought up to believe 
clockwork angels
high above the city square globes of light float in mid-air 
higher still, against the night clockwork angels bathed in light 
you promise every treasure, to the foolish and the wise 
goddesses of mystery, spirits in disguise 
every pleasure, we bow and close our eyes 
clockwork angels, promise every prize 
clockwork angels, spread their arms and sing 
synchronized and graceful, they move like living things 
goddesses of light, of sea and sky and land 
clockwork angels, the people raise their hands - as if to fly 
all around the city square power shimmers in the air 
people gazing up with love to those angels high above 
celestial machinery - move through your commands 
goddesses of mystery, so delicate and so grand 
moved to worship, we bow and close our eyes 
lean not upon your own understanding
ignorance is well and truly blessed 
trust in perfect love, and perfect planning 
everything will turn out for the best
stars aglow like scattered sparks 
span the sky in clockwork arcs 
hint at more than we can see 
spiritual machinery 
what do you lack?
the anarchist
will there be world enough and time for me to sing that song? 
a voice so silent for so long 
for all those years i had to get along, they told me i was wrong 
i never wanted to belong - i was so strong 
i lack their smiles and their diamonds; i lack their happiness and love 
i envy them for all those things, i never got my fair share of 
the lenses inside of me that paint the world black 
the pools of poison, the scarlet mist, that spill over into rage 
the things i've always been denied 
an early promise that somehow died 
a missing part of me that grows around me like a cage 
in all your science of the mind, seeking blind through flesh and bone 
find the blood inside this stone 
what i know, i've never shown; what i feel, i've always known 
i plan my vengeance on my own - and i was always alone 
oh - they tried to get me 
oh - they'll never forget me 
carnies
under the gaze of the angels 
a spectacle like he's never seen 
spinning lights and faces 
demon music and gypsy queens 
the glint of iron wheels 
bodies spin in a clockwork dance 
the smell of flint and steel 
a wheel of fate, a game of chance 
how i prayed just to get away to carry me anywhere 
sometimes the angels punish us by answering our prayers 
a face of naked evil turns the young boy's blood to ice 
deadly confrontation such a dangerous device 
shout to warn the crowd 
accusations ringing loud 
a ticking box, in the hand of the innocent 
the angry crowd moves toward him with bad intent 
halo effect
what did i see? 
fool that i was 
a goddess, with wings on her heels 
all my illusions projected on her 
the ideal, that i wanted to see 
what did i know? 
little by little, i learned 
my friends were dismayed to see me betrayed 
they knew they could never tell me 
what did i care? 
little by little, i burned 
maybe sometimes there might be a flaw 
how pretty the picture was back then 
what did i do? 
fool that i was to profit from youthful mistakes? 
it's shameful to tell how often i fell 
in love with illusions again 
so shameful to tell 
just how often i fell in love with illusions again 
a goddess with wings on her heels    
seven cities of gold
a man can lose his past, in a country like this 
wandering aimless 
parched and nameless 
a man could lose his way, in a country like this 
canyons and cactus 
endless and trackless 
searching through a grim eternity 
sculptured by a prehistoric sea 
stories that fired my imagination 
a splendid mirage in this desolation 
glowing in my dreams, like hallucinations 
glitter in the sun like a revelation 
distant as a comet or a constellation 
a man can lose himself, in a country like this 
rewrite the story 
recapture the glory 
a man could lose his life, in a country like this 
sunblind and friendless 
frozen and endless 
the nights grow longer, the farther i go 
wake to aching cold, and a deep sahara of snow 
that gleam in the distance could be heaven's gate 
a long-awaited treasure at the end of my cruel fate 
the wreckers
the breakers roar on an unseen shore 
in the teeth of a hurricane we struggle in vain 
a hellish night - a ghostly light appears through the driving rain 
salvation in a human chain 
all i know is that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true 
all i know is that sometimes the truth is contrary 
everything in life you thought you knew 
all i know is that sometimes you have to be wary 
'cause sometimes the target is you 
driven aground, with that awful sound 
drowned by the cheer from ashore 
we wonder what for 
the people swarm through the darkling storm 
gather everything they can score 'til their backs won't bear any more 
in the teeth of an icy grave 
the human chain leaves a bloody stain 
washed away in the pounding waves 
all i know is that memory can be too much to carry 
striking down like a bolt from the blue 
headlong flight
all the journeys of this great adventure 
it didn't always feel that way 
i wouldn't trade them because i made them 
the best i could and that's enough to say 
some days were dark 
i wish that i could live it all again 
some nights were bright 
all the highlights of that headlong flight 
holding on with all my might to what i felt back then 
i have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels 
steered the airships right across the stars 
i learned to fight, i learned to love and learned to feel 
oh, i wish that i could live it all again 
all the treasures 
the gold and glory 
it didn't always feel that way 
i don't regret it 
i never forget it 
i wouldn't trade tomorrow for today 
i learned to fight and learned to love and learned to steal 
bu2b2
i was brought up to believe belief has failed me now 
the bright glow of optimism abandoned me somehow 
belief has failed me now life goes from bad to worse 
no philosophy consoles me in a clockwork universe 
life goes from bad to worse i still choose to live 
find a measure of love and laughter and another measure to give 
i still choose to live and give, even while i grieve 
though the balance tilts against me i was brought up to believe 
wish them well
all that you can do is wish them well 
spirits turned bitter by the poison of envy 
always angry and dissatisfied 
even the lost ones, the frightened and mean ones 
even the ones with a devil inside 
thank your stars you're not that way 
turn your back and walk away 
don't even pause and ask them why 
turn around and say goodbye 
people who judge without a measure of mercy 
all the victims who will never learn 
even the lost ones, you can only give up on 
even the ones who make you burn 
the ones who've done you wrong 
the ones who pretended to be so strong 
the grudges you've held for so long 
it's not worth singing that same sad song 
even though you're going through hell just keep on going 
let the demons dwell 
just wish them well 
the garden
now we must tend our garden
in this one of many possible worlds, all for the best, or some bizarre test? 
it is what it is - and whatever 
time is still the infinite jest 
the arrow flies when you dream, the hours tick away - the cells tick away 
the watchmaker keeps to his schemes 
the hours tick away - they tick away 
the measure of a life is a measure of love and respect 
so hard to earn, so easily burned 
in the fullness of time a garden to nurture and protect 
in the rise and the set of the sun 
'til the stars go spinning - spinning 'round the night 
it is what it is - and forever 
each moment a memory in flight 
the arrow flies while you breathe, the hours tick away - the cells tick away 
the watchmaker has time up his sleeve 
the treasure of a life is a measure of love and respect 
the way you live, the gifts that you give 
in the fullness of time it's the only return that you expect 
the future disappears into memory with only a moment between 
forever dwells in that moment
